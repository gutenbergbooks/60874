</div>

<p>In the various periods of the world’s history men
have appeared who were gifted with greater
powers of mind and intelligence than the majority
of the people in whose age they lived, who, by
becoming the preceptors or teachers of the masses,
evidently fulfilled the designs of the Creator, by promoting
civilisation and happiness, by unity of thought
and knowledge. Such men were Æsop, William
Shakespeare, Fielding, Scott, and many others, and
later, in our own time, Thackeray and Charles Dickens.
One of the most ancient and interesting methods of
conveying instruction was by the art of Fable,
Allegory, or Parable.</p>

<p>Fable is an ingenious method of conveying advice
and instruction, without seeming so to do, by a
diverting little narrative, which, attracting attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
irresistibly chains it till the moral is imperceptibly
rooted in the mind, there to influence, for
the <em>better</em> it may be, all future actions of importance.
<em>Æsop</em> was, and <em>is</em>, the most favourite of Fabulists,
of whom a fair and goodly succession have since
appeared; but still <em>he</em> maintains, and will continue
to maintain the foremost place in literature as a
writer of instructive and entertaining Fables. We
here reprint an edition comparatively unknown in
the present generation, illustrated by the graver of
Bewick, and arranged by the pen of Goldsmith.
Bewick and Goldsmith’s <em>early</em> works are <em>comparatively</em>
unknown to the literary and reading
world. We all know that Bewick <em>designed</em> and
<em>engraved</em> the inimitable “British Quadrupeds,”
“Birds,” “Fables,” &amp;c., and that Goldsmith wrote
the “Vicar of Wakefield,” “Traveller,” “Deserted
Village,” &amp;c., but what do we know of their <em>early</em>
works—the <em>progressive steps</em> by which they attained
their wondrous and <em>well-earned</em> celebrity? It has
been the pleasing pursuit of the writer (for some
years) to search for, and rescue from destruction and
oblivion, all possible <em>early</em> works of Bewick and
Goldsmith. The result has exceeded his most
sanguine expectations. He has discovered at least
<em>twenty</em> little works written by Goldsmith during his
<em>weary</em> hours of adversity, all bearing <em>strong</em> internal
evidence of the author’s mind and style. (A work
on this subject is preparing for the press, profusely
illustrated with original woodcuts, &amp;c.) The early
editions of the <em>present</em> work were printed by T.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Saint, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. We will here give
a very brief <i lang="fr">resumé</i> of Bewick’s <em>earliest</em> works (published
by Saint), with a few woodcuts from the
<em>original</em> blocks, thus illustrating the <em>progressive</em>
<em>stages</em> of pictorial fine art by which Thomas Bewick
succeeded in producing the wood-engravings which
embellish the <em>present volume</em>, of which (edit. 1784)
Jackson, in his work on wood-engraving (1861, p.
480), says:—</p>

<p>“He (Bewick) evidently improved as his talents
were exercised; for the cuts in the “Select Fables,”
1784, are generally much superior to those in “Gay’s
Fables,” 1779. The animals are better drawn and
engraved; the sketches of landscape in the backgrounds
are more natural; and the engraving of
the foliage of the trees and bushes is not unfrequently
scarce inferior to that of his later productions.”</p>

<p>Jackson gives <em>three</em> examples of these Fable cuts
in his work, at pp. 480, 503 (“Wood-Engravings,”
1861). Thomas Bewick was apprenticed to R.
Beilby, October 1, 1767. It is probable that the cuts
given in next page are among the <em>very first</em> engraved
by Thomas Bewick during his apprenticeship, and
were used in “A New Invented Horn Book,” also
in “Battledores,” “Primers,” and “Reading Easies.”
He then executed the diagrams for Hutton on
Mensuration, 4to, 1770. One of the cuts is given
in “Jackson” (p. 475), a representation of St
Nicholas’ celebrated steeple. This is the first <em>known</em>
pictorial attempt of Bewick’s.</p>

<p class="caption">Facsimile of Bewick’s cut, St. Nicholas’ Steeple, Newcastle, 1770.</p>
</div>

<p>No doubt coarse cuts were done by Bewick about
this time for <em>local</em> Ballads, Broadsides, Garlands, and
Histories.</p>

<p>The next recognised work <em>I discovered myself</em>,
the “New Lottery-Book of Birds and Beasts, for
Children to learn their Letters by, as soon as they
can speak” (Saint, 1771, 32mo, bds. and gilt). Two
of the cuts follow.</p>

<p>The “Child’s Tutor” (Saint, 1772-73, square 24mo),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
cuts, with <em>verses</em>, &amp;c., by Oliver Goldsmith. The following
is undoubtedly by the Poet’s hand:—“The
Lilliputian Magazine; or, the Young Gentleman and
Lady’s Golden Library, being an attempt to mend
the World, to render the Society of Man more amiable,
and to establish the Plainness, Simplicity,
Virtue, and Wisdom of the Golden Age, so much
celebrated by the Poets and Historians—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">‘Man in that age no rule but Reason knew,</div>
<div class="verse">And with a native bent did Good pursue;</div>
<div class="verse">Unforc’d by Punishment, unaw’d by Fear,</div>
<div class="verse">His Words were Simple and his Soul Sincere.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(T. Saint, <i lang="la">circa</i> 1772, <em>early</em> Bewick woodcuts, 144 pp.
24mo.) The verse and title bear the <em>undoubted impress</em>
of his genius and style. Oliver Goldsmith
wrote it for J. Newbery, of London, but, as I shall
show in my larger work on this subject, there was
an arrangement between them by which Saint reprinted
many of his (Newbery’s) little books for
the North-Country trade. We then have “Moral
Instructions of a Father to his Son,” comprehending
the whole system of Morality, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and
“Select Fables,” extracted from Dodsley, and others,
<em>adorned with emblematical</em> cuts, 12mo, T. Saint,
Newcastle, 1772 and 1775. This, then, is one of the
<em>first</em> works of Saint’s we have seen containing cuts
of Fables.</p>

<p>Having a doubt respecting the cuts of this rare
book, I took my copy to Miss Bewick (Jan. 1867),
and inquired of her if they <em>were</em> engraved by her
father. She kindly gave me the following <em>authentic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
information</em>:—“The cuts <em>were</em> engraved by Thomas
Bewick in the first year of his apprenticeship
(1767-68), excepting the cut of a ship at sea, p.
167. This was engraved by David Martin, Bewick’s
fellow-apprentice, Bewick at this time disliking to
represent ‘water.’” This, then, sets all doubt at
rest respecting the cuts in an “Æsop’s Fables,”
“Gay’s Fables,” &amp;c., &amp;c., published by Saint about
this date, in which the <em>same</em> and similar cuts were
used. The following, used in “Gay,” is evidently
Bewick’s first attempt at the subject for which he
afterwards gained a premium.</p>

<p>The next is the <em>first</em> edition of the <em>present volume</em>,
“Select Fables” (T. Saint, Newcastle, 1776). In three
Parts. Part I. After the Manner of Dodsley’s.
Part II. Fables with Reflections. Part III. Fables
in Verse. To which are prefixed the Life of Æsop;
and An Essay upon Fable—(<em>same Verse and
Vignette, as in the 2d Edition, of 1784</em>). Containing
one hundred and fourteen cuts, <em>including</em> those
mentioned in the “Moral Instructions,” <em>described
above</em>, and fourteen larger and much superior cuts,
<em>with borders</em>, afterwards used with others in “Gay’s
Fables,” printed by T. Saint, in 1779. The same
vignette appears on the title as in the Second Edition
of this Book in 1784. It also has a copperplate
frontispiece, “R. Beilby delint. et sculpt.” 12mo,
211 pages, 2 pages of Index, &amp;c. (notice the <em>variations</em>
in the <em>title</em>, &amp;c., to the 1784 edition). The only
copy of this edition (1776) I ever had, or saw, is now
in the unique collection of E. B. Jupp, Esq., who has
kindly lent the block for the Frontispiece to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
Edition. It was engraved for “The Beauties of
Æsop” (Kendal, <i lang="la">circa</i> 1800-22), by Thomas Bewick,
and is somewhat like Beilby’s copperplate frontispiece
to 1776 Edition, but infinitely <em>improved</em>. It
contains about seventy delineations of animal and
bird life, &amp;c. (see the tailpiece at page 122 of <em>present</em>
edition, extremely like in arrangement, execution,
&amp;c.), while the portrait of Æsop is certainly the most
<em>reasonable</em> I have yet seen in examining the <em>numerous</em>
editions which have passed through my hands.</p>

<p>About this time, 1773 to 1776, many works issued
from Saint’s press—“Robinson Crusoe,” “Watt’s
Songs,” Oliver Goldsmith’s “Tommy Trip” (see my
reprint, of 1867), “Goody Two Shoes,” “Golden
Toy or Fairing,” “Tom Telescope’s Newtonian
Philosophy,” “Tommy Tagg’s Poems,” and <em>numerous</em>
others. Examples of cuts follow.</p>

<p>We now reach a period to which Bewick himself
thus refers at pages 59, 60 of his “Memoirs” (Longman,
1862):—“We were occasionally applied to by
(local) printers to execute woodcuts for them....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Orders were received for cuts for Children’s Books,
chiefly for Thomas Saint, printer, Newcastle, and
successor of John White, who had rendered himself
famous for his numerous publications of histories and
old ballads.... My time now became greatly taken
up with designing and cutting a set of wood blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
for the ‘Story-Teller,’ ‘Gay’s Fables,’ and ‘Select
Fables,’ together with cuts of a similar kind for
printers.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/preface-illus17.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following are among those referred to by
Bewick:—“Youth’s Instructive and Entertaining
Story-Teller, being a Choice Collection of Moral
Tales, Chiefly deduced from real Life, calculated to
enforce the Practice of Virtue, and expand every
social Idea in the Human heart. Adorned with
emblematical cuts from the most interesting part of
each Tale, and methodised after the Plan recommended
by the late ingenious Dr Goldsmith. To
which is added, by way of Preface, Thoughts on the
Present Mode of Education.” (Newcastle, T. Saint.)
Three Editions, <i lang="la">circa</i> 1774-7-8, 12mo, thirty-seven
woodcuts. The cuts in this book are larger than any
in the preceding books. We give the cut at page 48
of a Shipwrecked Sailor kneeling on a rock saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
his prayers, the tide rising around him, which is the
<em>first and earliest</em> engraving of this subject by T.
Bewick, afterwards one of his favourite Vignettes in
the “British Birds.” The others are all about the size
of the cuts in “Gay’s Fables,” 1779, or “Select
Fables,” 1784, and have similar borders.</p>

<p class="caption">“The Huntsman and Old Hound.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Jackson” refers to this and the following two
works:—“Gay’s Fables.” Fables by the late Mr
Gay, in One Volume complete, Newcastle, printed
by and for T. Saint, 1779, 12mo, <em>77 cuts of Fables,
with borders and 33 Vignettes</em>; for the tasteful and
clever engraving of five of the cuts (one, the Huntsman
and Old Hound<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) the Royal Society of Arts
presented Bewick with their medal; <em>it is further
embellished with a beautifully engraved Frontispiece,
by R. Beilby</em> (T. Saint, Newcastle, 1779). We give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
an impression of the <em>original</em> wood-engraving, exceedingly
interesting, as now Bewick seems to have
received the required impetus or encouragement to
produce the engravings for “Select Fables,” T. Saint,
1784. In three parts. Part I. Fables extracted from
Dodsley’s; Part II. Fables, with Reflections in Prose
and Verse; Part III. Fables in Verse; to which are
prefixed the Life of Æsop, and an Essay upon Fable,
A New Edition Improved. For this edition a <em>new set
of cuts</em> was engraved by Thomas Bewick. “These
cuts were then deemed superior to any of Bewick’s
previous productions.” The same year another impression
of this work was printed with the same title
page, but considerable variations in the letterpress,
and vignettes occur at pages 122, 125, and 152, which
are not in the former edition, printed in 1784, 12mo.
This is the book we now reprint (Saint’s collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of Bewick’s blocks having passed into my hands.)
An original copy of the 1784 edition in fine state is
so rare, that a copy has realised, at auction, £7, 10s.
Bewick says (p. 60, “Memoir,” 1862): “Some of the
Fable (“Gay,” 1779) cuts were thought so much of
by my master (Beilby), that he, in my name, sent
impressions of a few of them to be laid before the
Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c., and I
obtained a premium.” (Seven guineas, which he
took intense pleasure in presenting to his mother.)
We have thus, by easy stages, travelled through the
various phases of talent, to the most important work
produced before his <em>well-known</em> “British Quadrupeds,”
first published 1790; “British Birds,” 1797,
1804; and his <em>large</em> edition of “Æsop’s Fables,”
1818 (each work embellished with his inimitable
and ever-pleasing vignettes). Examples from all
these works follow.</p>

<p>These remarks are rapidly written, but they are
the result of years of research and study: so
that the reader of this Preface has a brief <i lang="fr">resumé</i>
of Bewick’s talents from his <em>earliest efforts</em> to his
most finished productions; a <em>result</em> which no one
living is able to give from the <em>original woodcuts</em>
but myself; thus forming a most useful manual
or pictorial <em>aid</em> to connoisseurs in selecting <em>early</em>
works illustrated by “Bewick,” the more <em>valuable</em>, as
scarcely any of the works mentioned as published by
Saint are in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Now, as to the “Goldsmith” interest as connected
with this work, the 1776 Newcastle edition was
evidently copied from “Dodsley’s” and other editions
of “Select Fables of Æsop” published in London
prior to this period. In the meantime, J. Newbery
and others, for whom Goldsmith wrote prefaces and
arranged and edited books, had published new
editions, so that when Saint went to press with
“A New Edition Improved” (with a new set of cuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
by the Bewicks), evidently the book was remodelled
and extended from one that Goldsmith had just
edited. In Dodsley’s Preface to his Fables, he says
“he has been assisted in it by gentlemen of the most
distinguished abilities; and that several, both of the
old and the new Fables, are not written by himself,
but by authors with whom it is an honour to be connected.”
Dodsley also refers to the Life of Æsop,
&amp;c., as being written by “a learned and ingenious
friend.” Doubtless Dr Johnson and Goldsmith were
the “authors,” and Goldsmith the “friend,” here
referred to. Be that as it may, the present work
bears sufficient internal evidence in the “Essay on
Fable,” the “Poetical Applications,” and the “Fables
in Verse,” that Oliver Goldsmith was the author;
for it is identical in style with numerous prefaces and
essays written about this period by Oliver Goldsmith
for Newbery, Dodsley, Griffiths, and others. Much
conclusive evidence on this interesting subject will
be given in my new book on “The early works of
Bewick and Goldsmith” (a Prospectus of which will
shortly be issued). The applications to this edition
are infinitely superior to any edition which had
appeared prior to its publication. In Sir Roger
L’Estrange and Croxall’s editions, the applications
were warped away from their original and intended
effect by political distortions and obsolete terms,
which often strayed far from, instead of assisting, the
subject. It is somewhat refreshing, then, in the
edition here reprinted, to meet with some applications
which are everything that could be desired, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
easy, naturally flowing, and apt language, just to the
point; and who was so much a master of such
language as Oliver Goldsmith?—of whom Dr Johnson
said, “He left no species of writing unadorned.”
It may be interesting here to quote from Bewick’s
Memoir of himself (not published till 1862), his
opinion of this book, which at once justifies the parent,
preceptor, or friend, in selecting this as a most <em>suitable</em>
present for the young of both sexes; he says
(pages 172-3):—“I was extremely fond of that
book (‘Æsop’s Fables’); and as it had afforded me
much pleasure, I thought, with better executed
designs, it would impart the same kind of delight
to others that I had experienced from attentively
reading it. I was also of opinion, that it had (while
admiring the cuts) led hundreds of young men into
the paths of wisdom and rectitude, and in that way
had materially assisted the pulpit.”</p>

<p>The lessons intended to be conveyed through the
medium of Fable are certainly plainer and easier to
be understood in this edition than in the once popular
“Croxall;” and the publishers believe, therefore, that
the book in its present form will be found a powerful
auxiliary in the important practical feeling for the
education of the rising generation, illustrated as it is
by the early but forcible and natural rendering of
these Fables by the inimitable Bewick, through the
medium of which is imparted the profound good
sense, wisdom, and experience of the ancient
philosophers. I have already exceeded the limits
of an ordinary Preface. On a future occasion I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
endeavour to show how <em>coincidently</em> Bewick and
Goldsmith worked together to produce results—the
importance of which can scarcely be fully estimated.
I will now conclude with one of those exquisite
little pictures of nature that will never cease to
exhibit the true art of pleasing as long as “the
language of England is spoken, or her literature
cultivated.”</p>

<h2>THE LIFE OF ÆSOP.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/line9.jpg" width="100" height="15" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Æsop, according to the best accounts, was a
native of Phrygia, a province of the <em>Lesser
Asia</em>, and born in the city Cotiæum.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was a
person of a remarkable genius, and extraordinary
character; for though he was born a slave, by the
assistance of his <em>genius</em> and <em>virtue only</em>, he procured
his own emancipation. By his sage counsels and
judicious advice he directed his countrymen to
measures that secured their liberty, and by a single
Fable baffled the tyrannical projects of Crœsus, King
of Lydia. The most part of writers agree that his
person was but unseemly, though there are some of a
contrary opinion.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is probable that he was of a
low and diminutive stature, though agreeable in his
complexion, and polite in his manners. It is, however,
certain that he had a great soul, and was
endowed with extraordinary mental qualifications;
his moral character approached to a degree of perfection
to which very few have attained. He appears
to have had a true sense of morality, and a just discernment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
of right and wrong; his perceptions and
feelings of truth were scrupulously nice, and the
smallest deviation from rectitude impressed his mind
with the greatest antipathy. No considerations of
private interest could warp his inclinations so as to
seduce him from the paths of virtue; his principles
were stedfast and determined, and truly habitual.
He never employed his great wisdom to serve the
purposes of cunning; but, with an uncommon exactness,
made his understanding a servant to truth.
Historians have given many instances of his wit and
shrewdness, which were always employed in the service
of <em>virtue</em>, <em>philanthropy</em>, and <em>benevolence</em>.</p>

<p>It cannot well be ascertained who were his parents,
though some have affirmed that his father was a
shepherd.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He himself was undoubtedly a slave;
his first master was an Athenian, whose name was
Caresias. At Athens he learned the Greek language
in perfection, and acquired a taste for writing moral
instructions, in the way of Fables, which was then
the prevailing mode of teaching morals in Attica.
His Fables are allegorical stories, delivered with an
air of fiction, under various personifications, to convey
truth to the mind in an agreeable manner. By
telling a story of a <em>Lion</em>, <em>Dog</em>, or a <em>Wolf</em>, the Fabulist
describes the manners and characters of men, and
communicates instruction without seeming to assume
the authority of a master or a pedagogue. Æsop’s
situation as a slave might suggest this method to
him; for what would have been scornfully rejected if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
delivered in an authoritative style by a slave, was
received with avidity in the form of a fable.</p>

<p>Æsop had several masters; his second master was
Xanthus, in whose service he discovered great wisdom
and sagacity in answering questions, and reconciling
differences. By the following stratagem he made his
master’s wife return back, after she had run away and
left him, and effectually reconciled them: our Fabulist,
then a slave, went to the market, and bought a
great quantity of the best provisions, which he publicly
declared were intended for the marriage of his
master with a new spouse. This report had its
desired effect, and the matter was amicably composed.
The story of his feast of <em>Neat Tongrege</em>, and
his answer to a gardener, are scarcely worthy of
relating. At a feast made on purpose to celebrate
the return of his master’s wife, he is said to have
served the guests with several courses of tongues, by
which he intended to give a moral lesson to his
master and mistress, who had by the too liberal use
of their tongues occasioned the difference which was
now agreed.</p>

<p>The third master of Æsop was Idmon, who was
surnamed the wise. Idmon was an inhabitant of the
island of Samos. During Æsop’s servitude with this
master, he had a fellow-servant called Rhodopis, who
some affirm was his wife.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This does not at all
appear credible, for there is no mention made of this
among the Greek writers. This Rhodopis became
afterwards very famous for her riches, and was celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
all over Greece. Idmon is said to have been
so well pleased with Æsop, that after he had been
some time in his service, he emancipated him, and
made him free. With the enjoyment of liberty, he
acquired new reputation, and became celebrated for
his wisdom. He is by some compared to the Seven
Sages of Greece, and accounted their equal in wisdom.
He had the honour to be acquainted with
Solon and Chilo, and was equally admitted with
them in the Court of Periander, the King of the
Corinthians, who was himself one of the Sages of
Greece. He was much esteemed by Crœsus, King
of Lydia, and received into his Court at Sardis.
During his residence at Sardis, he gave proofs of his
sagacity which astonished the courtiers of Crœsus.
This ambitious Prince having one day shewn his wise
men his vast riches and magnificence, and the glory
and splendour of his court, asked them the question,
whom they thought the happiest man? After several
different answers given by all the wise men present,
it came at last to Æsop to make his reply, who
said: <em>That Crœsus was as much happier than other
men as the fulness of the sea was superior to the rivers.</em>
Whether this was spoken ironically or in earnest does
not appear so evident; but according to the severe
morality of Æsop, it would rather appear to be a
sarcasm, though it was otherwise understood by the
King, and received as the greatest compliment. It
wrought so much upon his vanity, that he exclaimed:
<em>The Phrygian had hit the mark.</em> One thing which
renders it probable that Æsop flattered Crœsus on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
this occasion is his conversation with Solon, who at
this time departed from the court of the King of
Lydia. When they were upon the road, Æsop exclaims:
<em>O Solon! either we must not speak to Kings,
or we must say what will please them.</em> Solon replied:
<em>We should either not speak to Kings at all, or we should
give them good advice, and speak truth.</em> This seems
to be one instance in which Æsop is charged with
flattery and dissimulation. Some writers praise him
for his complaisance to so great a Prince; but it
is rather a proof of his policy than his ordinary
strictness and integrity. There is another instance
recorded by some writers of the life of Æsop, of his
complaisance to Princes, even contrary to the liberties
of the people. He is said to have written a Fable in
favour of the tyrant Pisistratus, which Phædrus has
translated, and proves that he was reconciled to
tyranny. But this is no way evident. There are
many Fables which are mingled with those of Æsop,
which are not his, yet have been fathered upon him;
and it is not consistent with the other parts of his
character and writings to suppose that he would
either flatter tyrants or defend them. The authorities
from whence these supposed facts are taken are
not to be depended upon.</p>

<p>In all other particulars he appears to have proceeded
upon the principles of wisdom, as far as any
of the Sages of Greece. When he was asked by
Chilo, one of the wise men, <em>What God was doing?</em>
He replied, with great adroitness, <em>That he was humbling
the proud and exalting the humble.</em> He had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
views of human nature, and assigned true reasons for
all its Phænomena. In an account of the paintings in
the time of the Antonines, Philostratus informs us,
that there is one of Æsop which makes a principal
figure. The painter represents him before his own
house, with the geniuses approaching him with a sort
of adulating pleasure as the inventor of Fables: they
are painted as adorning him with wreaths and chaplets
of flowers, and crowning him with olive branches.
His countenance appears in a smiling attitude, while
his eyes seem fixed towards the ground, as if composing
a Fable, with the same gaiety and good
humour with which he usually wrote. There is a
group of men and beasts placed around him, and
amongst the rest the Fox, which makes a capital
figure, as he does in the Fables. This picture does
not represent Æsop in a decrepit form, but sets him
forth with a mixture of gravity and good humour.
The image of his mind is well drawn by Plutarch in
his <em>Feast of the Sages at the court of Periander</em>, who
himself was one of the Seven. It was at this feast
that Æsop repeats his Fable of <em>The Wolf and the
Shepherds</em>, to shew that the company were guilty of
the same fault. From Plutarch’s account it is manifest
that Æsop’s conversation was pleasant and witty,
but yet delicate. He was satirical without disobliging,
and the poignancy of his wit was smoothed with good
nature and good sense.</p>

<p>The writer of his life prefixed to Dodsley’s Fables
compares him to Dean Swift, but with very little
propriety; for he has a delicacy in all his wit which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
the Dean of St Patrick’s was a total stranger to;
and, what is more strange, he had nearly as much
Christianity.</p>

<p>It has been doubted if he was the inventor of
Fables; but it is certain he was the first that brought
that species of writing into reputation. Archilochus
is said to have written Fables one hundred years
before him;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but it would appear that those stories
were not written for posterity like those of Æsop.
The Fables of Æsop were written in prose, though
the images that are in them afford good scope for a
poet, of which Phædrus has given an elegant specimen.
Æsop writes with great simplicity, elegance,
and neatness; the schemes of his Fables are natural,
the sentiments just, and the conclusions moral. Quintilian
recommends his Fables as a first book for
children;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and, when Plato had sent all the poets
into exile, he allows Æsop a residence in his commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The Athenians were good judges of
literary merit, and erected a noble statue for Æsop,
to perpetuate his memory, which was sculped by the
famous Lysippus.</p>

<p>The great excellency of Æsop’s manner of writing
is, that he blends the pleasing and the instructive so
well as to instruct and please at once. Horace is
much indebted to him for a plan of writing, and has
formed a rule from this famous Fabulist:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish I could conceal the exit of this great Fabulist
and Moral Writer. He was accused by the
Delphians of sacrilege, and convicted by an act of
the greatest villany that ever was invented. They
concealed among his baggage, at his departure, some
golden vessels consecrated to Apollo, and then dispatched
messengers to search his baggage. Upon
this he was accused of theft and sacrilege, condemned,
and precipitated over a rock. Thus ended the famous
Æsop, whose Fables have immortalised his memory,
and will hand down his name to the latest posterity.</p>

<h2>AN ESSAY UPON FABLE.</h2>

<p>Fable is the method of conveying truth under
the form of an Allegory. The sense of a Fable
is entirely different from the literal meaning of the
words that are used to compose it; and yet the real
intention thereof is visible and manifest, otherwise
the Fable is not well composed. The sense of a
Fable of the moral kind ought always to be obvious
at first view, that the instruction intended to be
given may have as early an effect as possible.</p>

<p>The chief thing to be considered in a Fable is the
<em>action</em>, which conveys the moral or truth designed for
instruction. There ought only to be one action in a
Fable, which must appear through the whole; otherwise
it will be liable to admit of different interpretations,
and be the same as a riddle, and have no
effect. <em>Clearness, Unity, and Probability</em>, are incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
essentially necessary in a moral Fable. If a
Fable be not so plain as to point out the sense of the
writer clearly, but admit of different interpretations,
it does not answer the true design thereof. If the
incidents tend to convey different ideas, then the
reader will be at a loss to understand the chief intention
of the author. All the various incidents ought
manifestly to unite in one design, and point out one
clear and perspicuous truth. Many of the modern
Fables labour under this defect; the incidents do not
manifestly tend to point out the moral. Fontaine’s
Fable of the two pigeons, and Croxall’s story of the
coach-wheel, are of this sort.</p>

<p>The incidents of a Fable ought also to have <em>a real
foundation in nature</em>. This rule may be infringed by
ascribing to creatures appetites and passions that are
not consistent with their known characters. “A Fox
should not be said to long for Grapes.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The rule
of Horace will hold universally—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sed non ut placidis cœant immitia: non ut</div>
<div class="verse">Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.</div>
<div class="verse">Delphinum Sylvis appingit Fluctibus aprum.</div>
<div class="verse right">—<span class="smcap">Horace</span>, I. 13.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span></p>

<div class="verse">To join the wild with creatures that are tame,</div>
<div class="verse">Serpents with birds, or tygers with the lamb,</div>
<div class="verse">Paint whales in woods, and wild boars in the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, what a motley piece the whole would be!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Creatures different in their nature must not be
associated in a just Fable. The Lamb must not be
made to travel with the Fox, nor the Wolf and the
Sheep to feed or associate together; for all this is
unnatural, and can never be rendered a <em>probable</em>
object of belief. The incidents in a Fable ought also
to be few, lest by crowding circumstances too close,
the whole appear confused, and perplex the mind.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered in Fable is the
<em>imagery</em> or <em>characters</em>; these may either be men,
beasts, or inanimate beings. All these have been
introduced by the ancient Fabulists. In all personifications
the rules of analogy are to be observed; in
those things wherein man and other creatures have
no similitude, no true image can be formed in what
respects human society. The persons and characters
assumed in Fables, ought therefore to have a likeness
to the things to which they are compared. All nature
may serve to furnish a Fabulist with machinery.
Mountains, rivers, trees, animals, and even invisible
powers may answer his purpose; but, in the use of all
sorts of machinery, a proper regard must always be
held to analogy. When language is attributed to
animals, they must not be made to speak in a style
which bears no similitude to some property in their
nature; an owl must not be made to sing like a
nightingale; nor should a raven be made the symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
of an orator. When beasts are made the representations
of men, there ought always to be something in
their nature that bears a similitude to their character.
The same may be said of things inanimate; a strong
man may be compared to a mountain, but it would be
preposterous to make the same comparison of a dwarf.
Vices and virtues ought in the same manner to be
delineated in Fable; a proud man may be compared
to a high hill, a humble person to a low valley. This
is authorised by the writings of the Old Testament:
<em>The high mountains shall be brought low, and every
valley shall be exalted.</em></p>

<p>When human actions are attributed to invisible
powers, or especially to the Deity, they ought to be
such as are worthy of those ideas which are generally
received concerning him. In this, Homer is very
faulty; for he exalts his men almost to Gods, and
brings down his Gods to the level of beasts.</p>

<p>As for the style of Fable, simplicity is the greatest
excellence; that familiar manner of speech in which
we converse is best suited for the purposes of Fable.
This manner of writing is more difficult to attain
than is generally imagined; it requires a particular
taste, and is harder to imitate than the sublime itself.
The style of a Fable must always be adapted to the
characters which are introduced: for it would be
absurd to make the eagle speak in the same style
with the bat; or the King of the forest express himself
in the language of the mouse. But in all these
particulars, nature will be the best guide; and where
this is deficient, no art can supply the want of it.</p>

<p>A Miller and his Son were driving their Ass
to market, in order to sell him: and that he
might get thither fresh and in good condition,
they drove him on gently before them. They had
not proceeded far, when they met a company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
travellers. Sure, say they, you are mighty careful
of your Ass: methinks, one of you might as well get
up and ride, as suffer him to walk on at his ease,
while you trudge after on foot. In compliance with
this advice, the Old Man set his Son upon the beast.
And now, they had scarce advanced a quarter of a
mile farther, before they met another company. You
idle young rogue, said one of the party, why don’t
you get down and let your poor Father ride? Upon
this, the Old Man made his Son dismount, and got up
himself. While they were marching in this manner,
a third company began to insult the Father. You
hard-hearted unnatural wretch, say they, how can
you suffer that poor lad to wade through the dirt,
while you, like an alderman, ride at your ease? The
good-natured Miller stood corrected, and immediately
took his Son up behind him. And now the next man
they met exclaimed, with more vehemence and indignation
than all the rest—Was there ever such a
couple of lazy boobies! to overload in so unconscionable
a manner a poor dumb creature, who is far less
able to carry them than they are to carry him! The
complying Old Man would have been half inclined to
make the trial, had not experience by this time sufficiently
convinced him, that there cannot be a more
fruitless attempt than to endeavour to please all mankind.</p>

rejoiced in this asylum, and for a while was very

However, making a virtue of necessity, he forbore to

said he, will tear my skin a little, yet they keep off

<p>A Country Maid was walking very deliberately with
a pail of milk upon her head, when she fell into the
following train of reflections:—The money for which
I shall sell this milk, will enable me to increase my
stock of eggs to three hundred. These eggs, allowing
for what may prove addle, and what may be destroyed
by vermin, will produce at least two hundred and fifty
chickens. The chickens will be fit to carry to market
about Christmas, when poultry always bear a good
price, so that by May-day I cannot fail of having
money enough to purchase a gown. Green!—let me
consider—yes, green becomes my complexion best,
and green it shall be. In this dress I will go to the
fair, where all the young fellows will strive to have
me for a partner; but I shall perhaps refuse every one
of them, and with an air of disdain toss from them.
Transported with this triumphant thought, she could
not forbear acting with her head what thus passed in

Monsieur to the savage, You have a very toilsome life
of it, who, when other people sit by the fireside, enjoying
the benefit of good food and good company,
are obliged to traverse the woods in the midst of
snow and storms to preserve a wretched existence.
How come you by your food? replies the Huron.
Does it rain from the clouds to you? No, says the
Frenchman; we work in summer, and make provision
for winter, and, during the cold months, sit by the fire
and enjoy ourselves. For the same reason, says the
Huron, do we lay up provisions in winter, that we
may rest in summer when the days are hot. Your
enjoyments are confined within the walls of a house,
and by the side of a fire, but ours are more extensive;
we assemble upon the mountains and in the woods in
summer for pleasure, and our delights are to observe
the works of nature; the sun serves us instead of fire
to warm us, and we are never at a loss for houses while
the woods remain. This is the season when we lay
up our store, and it serves us in summer till winter
return. We are accustomed to endure the cold, and
our exercise keeps us from feeling it to excess. At
night the skins of wild beasts keep us from the cold
till the morning dawn, and then we pursue the same
employments. Were we not to live in this manner,
the wild beasts would so increase, that they would
become our masters; but our necessity of having food
and clothing prevents them from increasing to very
great numbers. What you account pleasure, would
be none to us; and your manner of life appears as
ridiculous to the Hurons, as ours appears to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
You reckon us idolaters, because we pay adoration to
the rising sun; but you misunderstand us; we consider
that light to be a symbol of the great Author of
Nature, and only worship him through this luminary.
We do not understand your manner of worship, which
to us appears abundantly absurd; for the Deity is no
more like images of gold and silver, than he is like the
sun. The sun is a more glorious effect of his power
and goodness; for he serves many excellent purposes,
and we could not live without him; but your symbols
appear to have no use. The Frenchman could make
no reply, and the Huron proceeded on his hunting.</p>

a proud Lion one day to a Gnat that was
frisking about in the air near his den. The Gnat,
enraged at this unprovoked insult, vowed revenge, and
immediately darted into the Lion’s ear. After having
sufficiently teased him in that quarter, she quitted
her station and retired under his belly, and from
thence made her last and most formidable attack in
his nostrils, where stinging him almost to madness,
the Lion at length fell down, utterly spent with rage,
vexation, and pain. The Gnat having thus abundantly
gratified her resentment, flew off in great
exultation; but in the heedless transports of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>

she found herself unexpectedly entangled in the web

successfully carrying on his depredations, to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in a new character. To this end he disguised himself
in a shepherd’s habit; and resting his fore-feet upon
a stick, which served him by way of crook, he softly
made his approaches towards the fold. It happened
that the shepherd and his dog were both of them
extended on the grass fast asleep; so that he would
certainly have succeeded in his project, if he had
not imprudently attempted to imitate the shepherd’s
voice. The horrid noise awakened them both: when
the Wolf, encumbered with his disguise, and finding
it impossible either to resist or to flee, yielded up his
life an easy prey to the shepherd’s dog.</p>

The battle was so bloody and so obstinate that they

the taxes necessary for carrying on the business of

to them the following fable:—</p>

<p>My friends and countrymen, said he, attend to my
words. It once happened that the Members of the
human body, taking some exception at the conduct
of the Belly, resolved no longer to grant him the usual
supplies. The Tongue first, in a seditious speech,
aggravated their grievances; and after highly extolling
the activity and diligence of the Hands and
Feet, set forth how hard and unreasonable it was that
the fruits of their labour should be squandered away
upon the insatiable cravings of a fat and indolent
Paunch, which was entirely useless, and unable to do
anything towards helping himself. This speech was
received with unanimous applause by all the Members.
Immediately the Hands declared they would work no
more; the Feet determined to carry no further the
load of guts with which they had hitherto been oppressed;
nay, the very Teeth refused to prepare a
single morsel more for his use. In this distress, the
Belly bethought them to consider maturely, and not
foment so senseless a rebellion. There is none of you,
says he, can be ignorant that whatsoever you bestow
upon me is immediately converted to your use, and
dispersed by me for the good of you all into every
Limb. But he remonstrated in vain; for during the
clamours of passion, the voice of reason is always
disregarded. It being therefore impossible for him
to quiet the tumult, he starved for want of their
assistance, and the body wasted away to a skeleton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The Limbs, grown weak and languid, were sensible at
last of their error, and would fain have returned to
their respective duties; but it was now too late, death
had taken possession of the whole, and they all
perished together.</p>

<p>An Eagle and an Owl having entered into a league

sweetness and vivacity in their countenances; and
then there is something in their voices so peculiarly

these marks I cannot fail of distinguishing them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

grim-faced ugly birds, with gloomy countenances,
and a voice like that of the Furies. These, undoubtedly,
said he, cannot be the offspring of my friend,
and so I shall venture to make free with them. He
had scarce finished his repast and departed, when the
Owl returned; who, finding nothing of her brood remaining
but some fragments of the mangled carcases,
broke out into the most bitter exclamations against
the cruel and perfidious author of her calamity. A
neighbouring Bat, who overheard her lamentations,
and had been witness to what had passed between
her and the Eagle, very gravely told her that she had

<p>A Lion, having surfeited himself with feasting
too luxuriously on the carcase of a wild boar,
was seized with a violent and dangerous disorder.
The beasts of the forest flocked in great numbers to
pay their respects to him upon the occasion, and
scarce one was absent except the Fox. The Wolf,
an ill-natured and malicious beast, seized this opportunity
to accuse the Fox of pride, ingratitude, and
disaffection to his majesty. In the midst of his
invective, the Fox entered; who having heard part
of the Wolf’s accusation, and observing the Lion’s
countenance to be kindled into wrath, thus adroitly
excused himself, and retorted upon his accuser: I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
many here who with mere lip service have pretended
to shew you their loyalty; but for my part, from the
moment I heard of your majesty’s illness, neglecting
useless compliments, I employed myself day and
night to enquire among the most learned physicians
an infallible remedy for your disease, and have at
length happily been informed of one. It is a plaister
made of part of a Wolf’s skin, taken warm from his
back, and laid to your majesty’s stomach. This
remedy was no sooner proposed than it was determined
that the experiment should be tried; and
whilst the operation was performing, the Fox, with
a sarcastic smile, whispered this useful maxim in the
Wolf’s ear—If you would be safe from harm yourself,
learn for the future not to meditate mischief
against others.</p>

admired the beauty of his majesty’s paws, so happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

This fulsome adulation, instead of being received as
he expected, proved no less offensive than the rudeness
of the Bear; and the courtly Monkey was in
like manner extended by the side of Sir Bruin. And
now his majesty cast his eye upon the Fox. Well,
Reynard, said he, and what scent do you discover

<span class="gothic">The Cock and the Jewel.</span></h3>

<p>A brisk young Cock, in company with two or
three pullets, his mistresses, raking upon a
Dunghill for something to entertain them with, happened
to scratch up a jewel. He knew what it was
well enough, for it sparkled with an exceeding bright
lustre; but, not knowing what to do with it, endeavoured
to cover his ignorance under a gay contempt.
So, shrugging up his wings, shaking his
head, and putting on a grimace, he expressed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to this purpose: Indeed you are a very fine
thing; but I know not any business you have here.
I make no scruple of declaring that my taste lies
quite another way; and I had rather have one grain
of dear, delicious barley, than all the jewels under
the sun.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Morals.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Several very pretty fellows, who are as great strangers to the
true uses of virtue and knowledge as the Cock upon the
Dunghill is to the real value of the Jewel, endeavour to
palliate their ignorance by pretending that their taste lies
another way.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>There are several people in the world that pass, with
some, for well-accomplished gentlemen, and very
pretty fellows, though they are as great strangers to
the true uses of virtue and knowledge as the Cock
upon the Dunghill is to the real value of the Jewel.
He palliates his ignorance by pretending that his
taste lies another way: But whatever gallant airs
people may give themselves upon these occasions,
without dispute, the solid advantages of virtue, and
the durable pleasures of learning, are as much to be
preferred before other objects of the senses as the
finest brilliant diamond is above a barley-corn. The
greatest blockheads would appear to understand what
at the same time they affect to despise; and nobody
yet was ever so vicious as to have the impudence to
declare in public that virtue was not a fine thing.</p>

<p>But still, among the idle, sauntering, young fellows
of the age, who have leisure as well to cultivate and
improve the faculties of the mind as to dress and
embellish the body, how many are there who spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
their days in raking after new scenes of debauchery,
in comparison of those few who know how to relish
more reasonable entertainments! Honest, undesigning
good sense is so unfashionable, that he must be
a bold man who at this time of day attempts to bring
it into esteem.</p>

<p>How disappointed is the youth who, in the midst
of his amorous pursuits, endeavouring to plunder an
outside of bloom and beauty, finds a treasure of impenetrable
virtue concealed within! And why may
it not be said, how delighted are the fair sex, when,
from among a crowd of empty, frolic, conceited
admirers, they find out and distinguish, with their
good opinion, a man of sense, with a plain, unaffected
person, which at first sight they did not like!</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable II.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The City Mouse and Country Mouse.</span></h3>

<p>A Country Mouse invited a City Sister of
hers to a collation, where she spared for
nothing that the place afforded—as mouldy crusts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
cheese-parings, musty oatmeal, rusty bacon, and the
like. The City Dame was too well bred to find
fault with her entertainment; but yet represented
that such a life was unworthy of a merit like hers;
and letting her know how splendidly she lived, invited
her to accompany her to town. The Country
Mouse consented, and away they trudged together,
and about midnight got to their journey’s end. The
City Mouse shewed her friend the larder, the pantry,
the kitchen, and other offices where she laid her
stores; and after this, carried her into the parlour,
where they found, yet upon the table, the relics of a
mighty entertainment of that very night. The City
Mouse carved her companion of what she liked best,
and so to it they fell upon a velvet couch. The
Country Mouse, who had never seen or heard of such
doings before, blessed herself at the change of her
condition—when, as ill luck would have it, all on a
sudden the doors flew open, and in comes a crew of
noisy servants of both sexes, to feast upon the
dainties that were left. This put the poor mice to
their wits’ end how to save their skins—the stranger
especially, who had never been in such danger before.
But she made a shift, however, for the present to
slink into a corner, where she lay trembling and
panting till the company went away. As soon as
ever the house was quiet again: Well, my Court
Sister, says she, if this be the sauce to your rich
meats, I’ll e’en back to my cottage and my mouldy
cheese again; for I had much rather lie nibbling of
crusts, without fear or hazard, in my own hole, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be mistress of all the delicacies in the world, and
subject to such terrifying alarms and dangers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Morals.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>How infinitely superior are the delights of a private
life to the noise and bustle of a public one! Innocence,
security, meditation, good air, health, and
unbroken rest, are the blessings of the one; while the
rages of lust and wine, noise, hurry, circumvention,
falsehood, treachery, confusion, and ill health, are the
constant attendants of the other.</p>

<p>The splendour and luxury of a court are but a
poor recompense for the slavish attendances, the invidious
competitions, and the mortal disappointments
that accompany it. The uncertain favour of Princes,
and the envy of those who judge by hearsay or
appearance, without either reason or truth, make
even the best sort of court lives miserable, to say
nothing of the innumerable temptations, vices, and
excesses of a life of pomp and pleasure. Let a man
but set the pleasing of his palate against the surfeits
of gluttony and excess; the starving of his mind
against a pampered carcase; the restless importunities
of tale-bearers and back-friends against fair words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and professions, only from the teeth outwards; let
him, I say, but set the one in balance against the
other, and he shall find himself miserable, even in the
very height of his delights. To say all in a word:
Let him but set the comforts of a life spent in noise,
formality, and tumult, against the blessings of a
retreat with competency and freedom, and then cast
up his account.</p>

<p>What man, then, that is not stark mad, will voluntarily
expose himself to the imperious brow-beatings
and scorns of great men! To have a dagger struck
to his heart in an embrace! To be torn to pieces by
calumny; nay, to be a knave in his own defence!
For the honester, the more dangerous in a vicious
age, and where it is a crime not to be like the company.
Men of that character are not to be read and
understood by their words, but by their interests;
their promises and protestations are no longer binding
than while they are profitable to them.</p>

<p>After all, to keep the fable more closely in view,
let a man, with the Country Mouse, reflect on the
peace and safety of rural retirement, and prefer, if he
can, the insecurity, noise, and hurry of a more exalted
fortune.</p>

<p>A Crow having taken a piece of cheese out of a
cottage window, flew up into a high tree with it,
in order to eat it. Which a Fox observing, came and
sat underneath, and began to compliment the Crow
upon the subject of her beauty. I protest, says he, I
never observed it before, but your feathers are of a
more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my
life! Ah! what a fine shape and graceful turn of body
is there! And I make no question but you have a
tolerable voice. If it is but as fine as your complexion,
I do not know a bird that can pretend to
stand in competition with you. The Crow, tickled
with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled
about, and hardly knew where she was; but thinking
the Fox a little dubious as to the particular of her
voice, and having a mind to set him right in that
matter, began to sing, and, in the same instant, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the cheese drop out of her mouth;—which the Fox
presently chopt up, and then bade her remember
that whatever he had said of her beauty, he had
spoken nothing yet of her brains.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>Flattery in itself is an unmanly, slavish vice; but it
is much worse yet for the alliance it has to hypocrisy;
for while we make other people think better of <em>themselves</em>
than <em>they</em> deserve, we make them think better
of <em>us</em> too than <em>we</em> deserve: For self-love and vanity
on the one hand, assists the falseness and confidence
on the other, while it serves to confirm weak minds
in the opinion they had of themselves before, and
makes them parties effectually in a conspiracy to
their own ruin. The only benefit or good of Flattery
is this; that by hearing what we <em>are not</em>, we may be
instructed what we <em>ought to be</em>. Yet how few are
there among the whole race of mankind, who may be
said to be full proof against its attacks! The gross
way by which it is managed by some silly practitioners,
is enough to alarm the dullest apprehension,
and make it to value itself upon the quickness of its
insight into the little plots of this nature. But, let
the ambuscade be disposed with due judgment, and
it will scarce fail of seizing the most guarded heart.
How many are tickled to the last degree with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
pleasure of Flattery, even while they are applauded
for their honest detestation of it! There is no way
to baffle the force of this engine, but by every one’s
examining impartially for himself the true estimate
of his own qualities: If he deals sincerely in the
matter, nobody can tell so well as himself what
degree of esteem ought to attend any of his actions;
and therefore he should be entirely easy as to the
opinion men are like to have of them in the world.
If they attribute more to him than is his due, they
are either designing or mistaken; if they allow him
less, they are envious, or, possibly, still mistaken;
and, in either case, are to be despised, or disregarded.
For he that flatters without designing to make advantage
of it, is a fool: And whoever encourages that
Flattery, which he has sense enough to see through,
is a vain coxcomb.</p>

<p>An Ass and an Ape were conferring on grievances.

<p>Once upon a time the Hares found themselves
mightily unsatisfied with the miserable condition
they lived in. Here we live, says one of them,
at the mercy of men, dogs, eagles, and I know not
how many other creatures, which prey upon us at
pleasure; perpetually in frights, perpetually in
danger; and therefore I am absolutely of opinion,
that we had better die once for all, than live at this
rate in a continual dread that’s worse than death
itself. The motion was seconded and debated, and
a resolution immediately taken, by one and all, to
drown themselves. The vote was no sooner passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
but away they scudded with that determination to
the next lake. Upon this hurry there leapt a whole
shoal of Frogs from the bank into the water, for fear
of the Hares. Nay then, my masters, says one of
the gravest of the company, pray let’s have a little
patience. Our condition, I find, is not altogether so
bad as we fancied it; for there are those, you see,
that are as much afraid of us as we are of others.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>Since nature provides for the necessities of all
creatures, and for the well-being of every one in
its kind; and since it is not in the power of any
creature to make itself other than what by Providence
it was designed to be; what a madness is it to
wish ourselves other than what we are, and what we
must continue to be! Every atom of the creation has
its place assigned: every creature has its proper
figure, and there is no disputing with Him that made
it so. <em>Why have I not this?</em> and, <em>Why have I not
that?</em> are questions for a Philosopher of <em>Bedlam</em> to
ask; and we may as well cavil at the motions of the
heavens, the vicissitude of day and night, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
succession of the seasons, as expostulate with Providence
upon any of the rest of God’s works. The <em>Ass</em>
would have <em>horns</em>, the <em>Ape</em> would have a <em>tail</em>, and the
<em>Hares</em> would be free from those terrors which, timid
as they are, they give to others: but the <em>Mole</em> on the
one hand, and the <em>Frogs</em> on the other, shew that
there are others as miserable as themselves.</p>

<p>It may seem to be a kind of a malicious satisfaction
that one man derives from the misfortune of
another. But the philosophy of this reflection stands
upon another ground; for our comfort does not arise
from other people being miserable, but from this
inference upon the balance, that we suffer only the
lot of human nature: and as we are happy or miserable,
compared with others; so other people are
miserable or happy, compared with us; by which
justice of Providence we come to be convinced of the
sin, and the mistake, of our ingratitude. What would
not a man give to be eased of the gout, or the stone?
or, supposing an incurable poverty on the one hand,
and an incurable malady on the other, why should
not the poor man think himself happier in his rags,
than the other in his purple? but the rich man
envies the poor man’s <em>health</em>, without considering his
<em>want</em>; and the poor man envies the other’s <em>treasure</em>,
without considering his <em>diseases</em>. What is an ill
name in the world to a good conscience within one’s
self; and how much less miserable, upon the wheel,
is one man that is innocent, than another under the
same torture that is guilty? The only way for Hares
and Asses, is to be thankful what they are, and what
they have, and not to grumble at the lot that they
must bear in spite of their teeth.</p>

are so far from liking your company, that they kill
you as soon as they catch you. You are a plague to
them wherever you come. Your very breath has

<p>This fable marks out to us the difference betwixt

himself a truer image of a plain, honest, country
simplicity, than the Ant’s part of the dialogue in
this fable. She takes pains for what she eats; wrongs
nobody; and so creates no enemies; she wants nothing;
and she boasts of nothing; lives contented
with her own, and enjoys all with a good conscience.
This emblem recommends to us the blessings of a
virtuous privacy, according to the just measures of
right nature, and, in few words, comprises the sum of
a happy state.</p>

<p>The Fly, on the contrary, leads a lazy, voluptuous,
scandalous, sharking life; is hated wherever she comes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and in perpetual fears and dangers. She justly may
be compared with the worthless part of mankind, who
pass through the world without being of any service
in it; and without acquiring the least reputation,
seldom fail of adding pride to all their other failings,
and behave with haughtiness and arrogance towards
those who contribute to the comfort and happiness of
society. They treat industrious persons as wretched
drudges, appointed to labour for a poor subsistence;
while Heaven has provided everything for their own
use, though they of all others least deserve it. But
the worthy and industrious may always comfort themselves
with this reflection, that the pride and extravagance
of these idle creatures will at last bring them to
shame and want, while their own honest labours will
secure to them a life of plenty and affluence.</p>

<p>It is true she flutters from place to place, from feast
to feast, brags of her interest at court, and of ladies’
favours: and what is this miserable insect at last, but
the very picture of one of our ordinary trencher
Esquires, that spends his time in hopping from the
table of one great man to that of another, only to
pick up scraps of intelligence, and to spoil good
company; at other times officiously skipping up
and down from levee to levee, and endeavouring to
make himself necessary, wherever he thinks fit to
be troublesome.</p>

slunk aside, with this envious reflection between his
teeth, <em>What would I give to change conditions with that
happy creature there!</em> This fancy would not out of
the head of him, till it was his hap, a little while after,
to see this very Horse doing drudgery in a common
dung-cart. Why, how now, friend, says the Ass, how
comes this about? Only the chance of war, says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

death, and the lubricity of fortune; and by delivering
ourselves from the anxiety of hopes and fears.</p>

<p>It falls naturally within the prospect of this fiction
to treat of the wickedness of a presumptuous arrogance;
the fate that attends it; the rise of it; and
the means of either preventing or suppressing it; the
folly of it; the wretched and ridiculous estate of a
proud man, and the weakness of that envy that is
grounded upon the mistaken happiness of human life.</p>

<p>The folly both of the Horse and Ass may be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
here; the one in placing his happiness upon
anything that could be taken away; and the other, in
envying that mistaken happiness, under the abuse of
the same splendid illusion and imposture. What
signify gay furniture, and a pampered carcase, or
any other outward appearance, without an intrinsic
value of worth and virtue? what signify beauty,
strength, youth, fortune, embroidered furniture, gaudy
bosses, or any of those temporary and uncertain satisfactions
that may be taken from us with the very next
breath we draw? what assurance can any man have
of a possession that every turn of state, every puff of
air, every change of humour, and the least of a million
of common casualties, may deprive him of?</p>

<p>Moreover, the envy of the Ass was a double folly;
for he mistakes both the Horse’s condition and his
own. ’Tis madness to envy any creature that may
in a moment become miserable, or for any advantage
that may in a moment be taken from him. The Ass
envies the Horse to-day; and, in some few days more,
the Horse comes to envy him: wherefore let no man
despair, so long as it is in the power either of death,
or of chance, to remove the burden. Nothing but
moderation and greatness of mind can make either
a prosperous or an adverse fortune easy to us. The
only way to be happy is to submit to our lot; for no
man can be properly said to be miserable that is not
wanting to himself. It is certainly true, that many a
poor cobbler has a merrier heart in his stall, than a
prince in his palace.</p>

<p>The world will always form an idea of the character
of every man from his associates. Nor is this
rule founded on wrong principles; for, generally
speaking, those who are constant companions are
either drawn together from a similitude of manners,
or from such a similitude to each other by daily
commerce and continual conversation.</p>

<p>If bad company had nothing else to make us shun
and avoid it, this, methinks, might be sufficient, <em>that
it infects and taints a man’s reputation to as great a
degree as if he were thoroughly versed in the wickedness

who robs me of my money gives part of it to build a
church? Is he ever the less a thief? Shall a
woman’s going to prayers twice a day, save her
reputation, if she is known to be a malicious lying
gossip? No; such mixtures of religion and sin make
the offence but the more flagrant, as they convince us
that it was not committed out of ignorance. Indeed,
there is no living without being guilty of some faults,
more or less; which the world ought to be good-natured
enough to overlook, in consideration of the
general frailty of mankind, when they are not too
gross and too abundant. But, when we are so
abandoned to stupidity, and a neglect of our reputation,
as to keep bad company, however little we
may be criminal in reality, we must expect the
same censure and punishment as is due to the most
notorious of our companions.</p>

<p>It is very absurd to slight or insult another upon
his wanting a property which we possess; for he may,
for anything we know, have as just reason to triumph
over us, by being master of some good quality of
which we are incapable. But, in regard to the fable
before us, that which the Peacock values himself upon,
the glitter and finery of dress, is one of the most
trifling considerations in nature; and what a man of
sense would be ashamed to reckon even as the least
part of merit. Indeed, children, and those people
who think much about the same pitch with them, are
apt to be taken with varnish and tinsel; but they
who examine by the scale of common sense, must
find something of weight and substance before they
can be persuaded to set a value. The mind which
is stored with virtuous and rational sentiments, and
the behaviour which speaks complacence and humility,
stamp an estimate upon the possessor which all
judicious spectators are ready to admire and acknowledge.
But if there be any merit in an embroidered
coat, a brocade waistcoat, a shoe, a stocking, or a
sword-knot, the person who wears them has the least
claim to it; let it be ascribed where it justly belongs—to
the several artisans who wrought and disposed
the materials of which they consist. This moral is
not intended to derogate anything from the magnificence
of fine clothes and rich equipages, which, as
times and circumstances require, may be used with
decency and propriety enough. But one cannot help
being concerned lest any worth should be affixed to
them more than their own intrinsic value.</p>

<p>It is not every man’s talent to know when and how
to cast out a pleasant word, with such a regard to
modesty and respect as not to transgress the true and
fair allowances of wit, good-nature, and good breeding.
The skill and faculty of governing this freedom
within the terms of sobriety and discretion, goes a
great way in the character of an agreeable companion:
for that which we call raillery, in this sense,
is the very sauce of civil entertainment; and without
some such tincture of urbanity, even in matters the
most serious, the good-humour falters for want of
refreshment and relief; but there is a <em>medium</em> yet
betwixt <em>all-fool</em> and <em>all-philosopher</em>; I mean a proper
and discreet mixture, that in some sort partakes of
both, and renders wisdom itself so much the more
grateful and effectual. The gravity, in short, of the
one is enlivened with the spirit and quickness of the
other; and the gaiety of a diverting word serves as
a vehicle to convey the force of the intent and meaning
of it.</p>

<p>The Shepherd’s Boy, in short, to come closer to
the fable, went too far upon a topic he did not understand.
And he that is detected for being a notorious
liar, besides the ignominy and reproach of the thing,
incurs this mischief, that he will scarce be able to get
any one to believe him again as long as he lives.
However true our complaint may be, or how much
soever it may be for our interest to have it believed,
yet, if we have been frequently caught tripping before,
we shall hardly be able to gain credit to what we relate
afterwards. Though mankind are generally stupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
enough to be often imposed upon, yet few are so
senseless as to believe a notorious liar, or to trust a
cheat upon record. These little shams, when found
out, are sufficiently prejudicial to the interest of every
private person who practises them. But, when we
are alarmed with imaginary dangers in respect of the
public, till the cry grows quite stale and threadbare,
how can it be expected we should know when to
guard ourselves against real ones.</p>

explained. The Deer, viewing itself in the water, is
a beautiful young lady at her looking-glass. She
can’t help being sensible of the charms which lie
blooming in every feature of her face. She moistens
her lips, languishes with her eyes, adjusts every lock
of her hair with the nicest exactness, gives an agreeable
attitude to her whole body, and then, with a soft
sigh, says to herself, Ah! how happy might I be, in
a daily crowd of admirers, if it were not for the
censoriousness of the age! When I view that face,
where Nature, to give her her due, has been liberal
enough of charms, how easy should I be, if it were
not for that slender particular, my honour. The
odious idea of that comes across all my happy
moments, and brings a mortification with it that
damps my most flattering tender hopes. Oh that
there were no such thing in the world! In the midst
of these soliloquies, she is interrupted by the voice of
her lover, who enters her chamber singing a rigadoon
air; and, introducing his discourse in a familiar easy
manner, takes occasion to launch out in praise of her
beauty, sees she is pleased with it, snatches her hand,
kisses it in a transport; and in short, pursues his
point so close, that she is not able to disengage herself
from him. But, when the consequence of all this
approaches, in an agony of grief and shame, she
fetches a deep sigh, and says, “Ah! how mistaken

me; but the beauty I prized so much has been my
undoing.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>’Tis the nature of ingrates to return evil for good;
and the moralists in all ages have incessantly
declaimed against the enormity of this crime, concluding
<em>that they who are capable of hurting their
benefactors, are not fit to live in a community; being
such, as the natural ties of parent, friend, or country,
are too weak to restrain within the bounds of society</em>.
Indeed, the sin of ingratitude is so detestable, that,
as none but the most inhuman temper can be guilty
of it, so, in writing to men, there is no occasion to use
many words, either in exposing the vice itself, or dissuading
people from the commission of it. Therefore
it is not likely that a person of <em>Æsop’s</em> sagacity would
have compiled this fable, without having something
else in view, besides this trite and obvious subject.
He certainly intended to put us in mind, <em>That, as
none but a poor silly clown would go to take up a Snake
and cherish it, so we shall be very negligent and ill-advised,
if, in doing good offices, we do not take care to
bestow our benevolence upon proper objects</em>. It was not
at all unnatural in the Snake to hiss, and brandish
his tongue, and fly at the first that came near him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as soon at the person that saved his life as any other;
indeed more likely, because nobody else had so much
to do with him. Nor is it strange at any time to see
a reprobate fool throwing his poisonous language
about, and committing his extravagances against
those, more especially, who are so inadvertent as to
concern themselves with him. The snake and the
reprobate will not appear extraordinary in their
malevolence. But the sensible part of mankind cannot
help thinking those guilty of great indiscretion
who receive either of them into their protection.</p>

<p>A Gnat, half starved with cold and hunger,

<p>The many unhappy persons whom we daily see

how necessary it is to bring them up to industry and
business, be their present prospects ever so hopeful;
that so, upon any unexpected disaster, they might be
able to turn their hands to a course which might procure
them an honest livelihood.</p>

<p>The Gnat in the fable, we may further observe, is
very like many inconsiderate persons in life. They
gaily buz about in the <em>summer of prosperity</em>, and think
of nothing but their present enjoyments: but when
the <em>winter of adversity</em> comes, they poorly creep
about, and supplicate the industrious inhabitants of
every <em>Bee-hive</em>, charitably to relieve those wants
which they have brought upon themselves; and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
deservedly meet the repulse, and the sting, which the
Bee gives to the Gnat in the fable. We have seen
many a doted-on child, who has been brought up to
singing, dancing, and all the gay delights of this
world, and yet has been forced to shut up the last
scene of a miserable life in want and beggary; which
had been prevented, if they had been early taught
the value of industry and independency, and the
means, by the former, of attaining the latter.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XVII.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">Mercury and the Woodman.</span></h3>

<p>A Man was felling a tree on the bank of a river;
and by chance let his hatchet slip out of his
hand, which dropt into the water, and immediately
sunk to the bottom. Being therefore in great distress
for the loss of his tool, he sat down and bemoaned
himself most lamentably. Upon this, <em>Mercury</em> appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to him, and, being informed of the cause of
his complaint, dived to the bottom of the river, and
coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet,
demanding if that were his. He denied that it was.
Upon which <em>Mercury</em> dived a second time, and
brought up a silver one. The man refused it, alleging
likewise that this was not his. He dived a third
time, and fetched up the individual hatchet the man
had lost; upon sight of which the poor wretch was
overjoyed, and took it with all humility and thankfulness.
<em>Mercury</em> was so pleased with the fellow’s
honesty, that he gave him the other two into the
bargain, as a reward for his just dealing. The man
goes to his companions, and giving them an account
of what had happened, one of them went presently to
the river’s side, and let his hatchet fall designedly
into the stream. Then sitting down upon the bank,
he fell a weeping and lamenting, as if he had been
really and sorely afflicted. <em>Mercury</em> appeared as
before, and diving, brought him up a golden hatchet,
asking if that was the hatchet he lost. Transported
at the precious metal, he answered, Yes; and went
to snatch it greedily. But the god detesting his
abominable impudence, not only refused to give him
that, but would not so much as let him have his own
hatchet again.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>The answer of the humble Bramble to the proud
Fir-tree is so pathetic, that it may of itself serve for
a very good moral to this fable. Nothing of God’s
works is so mean as to be despised, and nothing so
lofty but it may be humbled; nay, and the greater
the height the greater the danger. For a proud great
man to despise an humble little one, when Providence
can so easily exalt the one, and abase the other, and
has not for the merit of the one, or the demerit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
other, conferred the respective conditions, is a most
inexcusable arrogance: and history has given numberless
instances, where the overgrown Fir, though a
Prime Minister, or great Prince, in the very height of
its pride, has been forced to submit to the executioner’s
axe, while the humble Bramble, or contented
poor man, has continued safe and unhurt in his lowly
obscurity. We may further observe on this fable,
that there is no state of life but has its mixture of
good and evil. The Fir may boast of the uses to
which it is put, and of its strength and stature; but
then it has not to boast of the creeping Bramble’s
safety; for the value of the one tempts the Carpenter’s
axe, while the poverty of the other makes it
little worth any one’s while to molest it. Upon the
whole matter, we may add, <em>That as pride or arrogance
is a vice that seldom escapes without a punishment; so
humility is a virtue that hardly ever goes without a
blessing</em>.</p>

country fellow in a wood, to whom he applied for
refuge, entreating that he would give him leave to
hide himself in his cottage, till the hounds were gone

covered himself up close in a corner of the hovel.
Presently the hunters came up, and inquired of the
man, if he had seen the Fox. No, says he, I have not
seen him indeed: but all the while he pointed with
his finger to the place where the Fox was hid.
However, the hunters did not understand him, but
called off their hounds, and went another way. Soon
after, the Fox, creeping out of his hole, was going to
sneak off; when the man, calling after him, asked
him, if that was his manners, to go away without
thanking his benefactor, to whose fidelity he owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>

seen what passed, answered, I know what obligations

<p>Ill dispositions may be dissembled for a while, but
nature is very hardly to be altered, either by counsel

experiment, to try how far ill-natured men, and other
creatures, may be wrought upon by fair usage and
good breeding; but the inclination and cruelty of
the dam will be hardly ever out of the Whelp.
<em>Thrust back nature with a pitch-fork</em>, says the poet,
<em>and it will return</em>. This Fable is a true portrait of
an ungrateful and treacherous mind, which, according
to the proverb, <em>holds with the Hare, and runs with
the Hound</em>; which pretends greater zeal than others,
like the Wolf’s Whelp in the chase, in the detection
and pursuit of a common enemy; but at the same
time divides spoils with him, and, rather than want
an opportunity of doing mischief, will prey privately
upon the property he pretends to defend. Many
such instances we might give in public life; and
there have been too many such also in private life.
The punishment so richly merited in the Fable is
heartily to be wished whenever they happen, and it

to murmur at the dispensations of Providence, and
to call for divine assistance to extricate them from

Industry includes in itself this double
blessing: It commonly enables us to gain the point
we aim at; and in that case heightens the relish of
our enjoyments, when we consider that we have
attained them by our own art and perseverance: but
if we should happen to fail in our endeavours, it excites

happened to be alone, he asked him his business.
He told him, that he was attending upon his minister,
as he had often done, for such a post in his
Majesty’s gift. The King asked him, what he was to
give for it to the minister? He said £1000. The
King humorously told him he should have it, and
bid him give him £500, and keep t’other £500 himself;
and if he or his friends wanted any more such
bargains, he might apply to <em>himself</em> directly, and be
served at half price.</p>

<p>We may improve a doctrine from this, that every
man has his <em>weak side</em>, either by mischance or by
nature; and that he makes it his business to cover it,
too, the best he can. In case of the worst, it is some
sort of ease to have company in misfortune. It puts
a man out of countenance to be in fashion by himself,
and therefore the Fox acted cunningly to try if he
could bring his fellow Foxes to put themselves into
his mode. When we have carried a point as far
as it will go, and can make no more of it, it is a
stroke of art and philosophy to look as if we did not
so much as wish for a thing that is not to be had.
Every man’s present condition has somewhat to be
said for it: if it be uneasy, the skill will be, either
how to <em>mend</em> it, or how to <em>bear</em> it; but then there
must be no clashing with the methods, the decrees,
and the laws of nature. A man that has forfeited his
honour and his conscience, seems to be much in the
condition of the Fox here that had lost his tail; and
oftentimes takes as much pains, too, to persuade all
his companions to follow his fashion, and be as corrupt
as himself, that he may bring the rest of the
world down to his own standard.</p>

<p>In respect to temporal affairs, they, who pretend to
advise what measures are most conducive to the public
welfare, are often guided entirely by their own private
interest: but whenever they counsel any extraordinary
innovations, or endeavour to change any established
proceedings long used and approved, we may be
almost certain that they have some other design,
rather than the promotion of the general good. When
new regulations are proposed, we should turn our eyes
on those who propose them, and consider with attention,
whether they have not some personal motives
for their conduct, and we should be particularly
cautious not to suffer ourselves to be imposed on by
<em>fine speeches</em> and <em>pretended patriotism</em>: for <em>he</em> who is
<em>very solicitous</em> to bring about a scheme, not attended
with any visible advantage to the community, must
only mean his own benefit; or, like the Fox, when
he has been caught himself in one trap, endeavour to
catch us in another.</p>

<p>A Presumptuous Scoffer at things sacred
took a journey to <em>Delphi</em>, on purpose to try if
he could put a trick upon <em>Apollo</em>. He carried a
sparrow in his hand under his coat, and told the god,
<em>I have something in my hand</em>, says he: <em>Is it dead or
living?</em> If the oracle should say it was dead, he
could show it alive; if living, it was but squeezing it,
and then it was dead. He that saw the iniquity of
his heart, gave him this answer: It shall e’en be which
of the two thou pleasest: for it is in thy choice to
have it either the one or the other, as to the bird, but
it is not in thy power as to thyself; and immediately
struck the bold scoffer dead, for a warning to others.</p>

<p>There is no playing fast and loose with God
Almighty, who sees the very thoughts of our hearts.
This way of fooling in holy things, is the very boldest
sort of impiety that can be practised. He that pretends
to doubt of an All-knowing power, has as much
right to doubt of an Almighty power too; and the
bringing of one attribute in question, opens the way
to a diffidence of all the rest. It would prevent a
great deal of wickedness in the world, if men would
but live and act in religious matters, so as to own and
to recognise the force and awe of a Deity in their
<em>practices</em>, as well as in their <em>words</em>: but when they
come to querying and riddling upon it, with an <em>If it
be so and so</em>, the scandal of the supposition is not to
be borne; for such a way of seeming to affirm a thing,
is but one remove from a flat denial of it. Such was
the Scoffer’s question here to the oracle, which implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
both the doubt of a divine Omniscience, and a curiosity
to discover the truth of the matter, with a banter at

<p>It is a great folly to fear that which it is impossible
to avoid; and it is yet a greater folly to fear the
remedy of all evils: for death cures all diseases, and
frees us from all cares. It is as great a folly again
not to prepare ourselves, and provide for an inevitable
fate. We are as sure to go out of the world, as we
are that ever we came into it; and nothing but the
conscience of a good life can support us in that last
extremity. The fiction of a Swan’s singing at her
death does, in the moral, but advise and recommend
it to us to make ready for the cheerful entertainment
of our last hour, and to consider with ourselves, that
if death be so welcome a relief even to animals,
barely as a deliverance from the cares, miseries, and
dangers of a troublesome life, how much a greater
blessing ought all good men to account it then, that
are not only freed by it from the snares, difficulties,
and distractions of a wicked world, but put into possession
(over and above) of an everlasting peace, and
the fruition of joys that shall never have an end!</p>

<p>To attain this desirable state of mind, it is necessary
that we reflect fully and frequently on the
uncertainty of all worldly affairs, how flitting and
transitory, and how barren of real happiness, they
are; and to endeavour at a proper discharge of our
duty to <em>society</em>, by acting well the part assigned us
in it, and managing the talents committed to our
care, to beneficial ends and purposes; to our <em>Creator</em>,
by a constant and humble acquiescence in the dispensations
of His providence, and sincere and grateful
acknowledgments for His numberless mercies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to <em>ourselves</em>, by restraining inordinate and unlawful
desires, and bridling our dissolute and licentious
affections, duly considering, that as we bear the
stamp and image of the Deity, every debasement
and pollution offered to our persons is an affront and
indignity to Him, and contrary to His express commands:
By a constant attention to these things, we
may be enabled to meet death without fear. The
consciousness of a well-spent life strips the tyrant of
all his terrors; then, like the Swan in the Fable, we
shall consider him as a welcome visitant that will
ease us of this load of mortality, and usher us into a
state of inexpressible felicity.</p>

<p>Every man should examine the strength of his

fondly flatter himself by measuring his own talents
by the false standard of the abilities of another. We
can no more adopt the genius of another man than
assume his shape and person; and an imitation of
his manner would no more become us than his
clothes. Man is indeed an imitative animal; but
whatever we take from general observation, without
servilely copying the practice of any individual, becomes
so mixed and incorporated with our notions
that it may fairly be called our own. Almost every
man has something original in himself, which, if duly
cultivated, might perhaps procure him esteem and
applause; but if he neglects his natural talents, or
perverts them by an absurd imitation of others, he
becomes an object of ridicule; especially, if he attempts
to perform things beyond the compass of his
strength or understanding.</p>

The Cock crowed about midnight (at his usual hour),
which brought a Fox that was abroad upon the hunt
immediately to the tree; and there he stood licking
of his lips at the Cock, and, wheedling him to get
him down, he protested he never heard so angelical
a voice since he was born; and what would not he
do now, to hug the creature that had given him so
admirable a serenade? Pray, says the Cock, speak
to the porter below to open the door, and I’ll come
down to you. The Fox, little dreaming of the Dog
so near, did as he was directed, and the Dog presently

Well, says the Grasshopper, but I was not idle neither;

<p>It is hard to say of laziness or luxury, whether it
be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous evil.
The very soul of the slothful does but lie drowsing in
his body, and the whole man is totally given up to
his senses; whereas the profit and the comfort of industry
are substantial, firm, and lasting; the blessings of
security and plenty go along with it, and it is never
out of season. What is the Grasshopper’s entertainment
now, but a summer’s song? A vain and empty
pleasure? Let it be understood, however, that we
are not to pass avarice upon the world under title of
good-husbandry and thrift, and thereby utterly to
extinguish charity. We are indeed, in the first place,
to consult our own necessities; but we are then to
consider, in the second, that the necessities of our
neighbours have a Christian right to a part of what
we have to spare.</p>

<p>The stress of this moral lies upon the preference
of honest labour to idleness; and the refusal of relief,
on the one hand, is intended only for a reproof to
the inconsiderate loss of opportunity on the other.
This does not hinder yet, but that the Ants, out of
their abundance, ought to have relieved the Grasshopper
in her distress, though it was her own fault
that brought her to it; for if one man’s <em>faults</em> could
discharge another man of his <em>duty</em>, there would be no
longer any place left for the common offices of
society. To conclude, we have our failings, every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of us; and the improvidence of my neighbour must
not make me inhuman. The Ant did well to reprove
the Grasshopper for her slothfulness; but she did ill,
after that, to refuse her charity in her distress.</p>

<p>It is one of the most vexatious mortifications, perhaps,
of a sober and studious man’s life, to have his

discomposed, by the importunity of a tedious and
impertinent visit; especially if it be from a fool of
quality, where the station of the man entitles him to
all returns of good manners and respect. The drift
of this fable is to tell us, that good books and good
thoughts are the best company, and that they are
mistaken, who think a wise man can ever be alone.
It prepares us also to expect interruptions and disappointments,
and to provide for them; but withal
to take the best care we can to prevent the plague of
ill company, by avoiding the occasions of it. The
linking of a man of brains and honesty, with a lewd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

<p>An Ass, in a hard winter, wished for a little warm
weather, and a mouthful of fresh grass to nap
upon, in exchange for a heartless truss of straw, and
a cold lodging. In good time the warm weather and
the fresh grass came on; but so much toil and business
along with it, that the Ass grows quickly as sick
of the spring as he was of the winter. He next longs
for summer; and when that comes, finds his toils and
drudgery greater than in the spring; and then he
fancies he shall never be well till autumn comes: but
there again, what with carrying apples, grapes, fuel,
winter provisions, and such like, he finds himself in a
greater hurry than ever. In fine, when he has trod
the circle of the year in a course of restless labour,
his last prayer is for winter again, and that he may
but take up his rest where he began his complaint.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>There is no measure to be taken of an unsteady
mind: but still it is either too much or too little, too
soon or too late. The love of novelty begets and
increases the love of novelty; and the oftener we
change, the more dangerous and troublesome do we
find this itch of variety to be. The Ass was sick of
the winter, sicker yet of the spring, more sick still of
the summer; and sickest of all of the autumn; till
he is brought, in the end, to compound for his first
condition again, and so take up with that for his satisfaction,
which he reckoned upon before for his misfortune.</p>

<p>Thus it is, when fickle and foolish people will be
prescribing to, and refining upon, the wise and gracious
appointments of the Maker of the world. They
know not what they <em>are</em>, and they know not what
they <em>would be</em>, any farther, than that they would not
be what <em>they are</em>. Let their present state in the
world be what it will, there is still something or
other in it that makes their lives wearisome: and
they are as peevish company to themselves too, as
they are to their friends and neighbours; for there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
not one circumstance in nature, but they shall find
matter to pick a quarrel at: the <em>present</em> is only the
course of so many moments into time <em>to come</em>: were
it not better then for people at first to sit down contentedly
in the post where Providence has placed
them, and <em>to do their duty in that state of life</em>, as they
are early and excellently taught, <em>to which it has
pleased God to call them</em>, than be forced to do it at
last, by the dear bought experience of their follies?</p>

<p>This, however, we say, not to bar honest industry,
or a sober application to those studies or means that
may probably contribute to the mending of a man’s
fortune; provided that he set up his resolution beforehand,
not to let himself down below the dignity of a
wise man, be the issue of his endeavours what it will.
For he that is not content at <em>present</em>, carries the same
weakness along with him to the <em>next remove</em>; and whoever
either passionately covets any thing that he has
not, or feels himself glutted with a satiety of what he
possesses, has already lost his hold: so that if we
would be happy, we must fix upon some foundation
that can never deceive us, and govern ourselves by
the measures of sobriety and justice.</p>

<p>If we look round us in the world, and likewise
examine our own hearts, we shall find that one of the
principal sources of our discontent, is the making of
a false estimate of our own and our neighbours’
abilities, and thence drawing conclusions that lead us
into difficulties. Does any citizen hold a considerable
office? Or is he eminent for his fortune? That
<em>envy</em>, inherent in our nature, prompts us to examine,
by what title he enjoys those benefits and distinctions,
that lift him above the level of the community; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
same principle leads us to overlook, in some measure,
his good qualities, and greatly to exaggerate his bad
ones. We are tempted next to make a comparison
between him and ourselves, and by looking through
the other end of the perspective, imagine that the
balance is greatly in our favour, and without further
process or examination conclude, that the world
ought to abide by our decision; hence the numberless
disappointments we meet with; hence all the
uneasiness we feel in every stage and station of life.
Were we to pay a proper attention to that celebrated
sentence of the Delphic oracle,</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Know Thyself</span>,”</p>

<p class="noindent">we should experience fewer disappointments, become
better members of society, and enjoy a greater portion
of that tranquillity of soul, that internal serenity
of mind, without which every station in life, however
garnished with honours, however loaded with riches,
may be <em>pronounced miserable</em>.</p>

<span class="gothic">The Undutiful Young Lion.</span></h3>

<p>Among other good counsels that an old experienced
Lion gave to his whelp, this was one,
that he should never contend with a man: for, says
he, if ever you do, you’ll be worsted. The little
Lion gave his father the hearing, and kept the advice
in his thought, but it never went near his heart.
When he came to be grown up, afterwards, and in
the flower of his strength and vigour, about he ranges
to look for a man to grapple with. In his ramble he
met with a yoke of oxen, and then with a horse,
saddled and bridled, and severally asked them if they
were men; but they saying they were not, he goes
after this to one that was cleaving of blocks: D’ye
hear? says the Lion, you seem to be a man: And
a man I am, says the fellow. That’s well, quoth the
Lion, and dare you fight with me? Yes, says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
man, I dare: why, I can tear all these blocks to
pieces, you see. Put your feet now into this gap,
where you see an iron thing there, and try what you
can do. The Lion presently put his paws into the
gaping of the wood, and with one lusty pluck made
it give way, and out drops the wedge; the wood
immediately closing upon it, there was the Lion
caught by the toes. The Wood-man presently upon
this raises the country, and the Lion finding what a
strait he was in, gave one hearty twitch and got his
feet out of the trap, but left his claws behind him.
So away he goes back to his father, all lame and
bloody, with this confession in his mouth: Alas! my
dear father, says he, <em>this had never been, if I had
followed your advice</em>.</p>

<p>It is the lot of mankind to be happy and miserable
by turns. The wisdom of Providence will have it so;
and it is exceedingly for our advantage that so it
should be. There is nothing pure and unmixed
under the heavens; and if there were, such an abstracted
simplicity would be neither nourishing nor
profitable to us. By the mediation of this mixture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
we have the comfort of Hope to support us in our
distresses, and the apprehensions of a change to keep
a check upon us in the very pride of our greatness:
so that by this vicissitude of <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em> we are
kept steady in our philosophy and in our religion.
The one minds us of God’s omnipotence and justice;
the other, of His goodness and mercy: the one tells
us, there is no trusting to our own strength; the
other preaches faith and resignation in the prospect
of an overruling Providence that takes care of us.
What is it but sickness that gives us a taste of health?
bondage, the relish of liberty? and what but the
experience of want that enhances the value of plenty?
that which we call ease is only an indolence or a freedom
from pain; and there is no such thing as felicity
or misery but by comparison. It is very true, that
hopes and fears are the snares of life in some respects,
but they are the reliefs of it in others. Now for fear
of the worst, however, on either hand every man has
it in his power, by the force of natural reason, to
avoid the danger of falling either into presumption
or despair.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XXXVIII.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Fox and the Ape.</span></h3>

<p>Once upon a time, the beasts were so void of
reason as to choose an Ape for their King.
He had danced, and diverted them with playing antic
tricks, and truly nothing would serve but they must
anoint him their sovereign. Accordingly crowned he
was, and affected to look very wise and politic. But
the Fox, vexed at his heart to see his fellow-brutes
act so foolishly, was resolved the first opportunity to
convince them of their sorry choice, and punish their
jackanapes of a king for his presumption. Soon
after, spying a trap in a ditch, which was baited with
a piece of flesh, he went and informed the Ape of it,
as a treasure, which, being found upon the waste,
belonged to his Majesty only. The Ape, dreaming
nothing of the matter, went very briskly to take possession,
but had no sooner laid his paws upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
bait, than he was caught in the trap; where, betwixt
shame and anger, he began to reproach the Fox,
calling him rebel and traitor, and threatening to be
revenged of him. At all which <em>Reynard</em> laughed
heartily; and going off, added, with a sneer, You a
king, and not understand trap!</p>

<p>A weak man should not aspire to be a king; for
if he were, in the end it would prove as inconvenient
to himself, as disadvantageous to the public. To be
qualified for such an office—an office of the last importance
to mankind—the person should be of a
distinguished prudence and most unblemished integrity;
too honest to impose upon others, and
too penetrating to be imposed upon; thoroughly
acquainted with the laws and genius of the realm
he is to govern; brave, but not passionate; good-natured,
but not soft; aspiring at just esteem; despising
vain-glory; without superstition; without
hypocrisy. When thrones have been filled by people
of a different turn from this, histories show what a
wretched figure they always made; what tools they
were to particular persons, and what plagues to their
subjects in general. They who studied their passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and entered into their foibles, led them by the nose
as they pleased; and took them off from the guardianship
of the public, by some paltry amusement,
that themselves might have the better opportunity
to rifle and plunder it.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XXXIX.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Satyr and the Traveller.</span></h3>

<p>A Satyr, as he was ranging the Forest in an
exceeding cold, snowy season, met with a
Traveller half-starved with the extremity of the
weather. He took compassion on him, and kindly
invited him home, to a warm comfortable cave he had
in the hollow of a rock. As soon as they had entered
and sat down, notwithstanding there was a good fire
in the place, the chilly Traveller could not forbear
blowing his finger ends. Upon the Satyr’s asking
him why he did so, he answered: That he did it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
warm his hands. The honest silvan having seen
little of the world, admired a man who was master of
so valuable a quality as that of blowing heat, and
therefore was resolved to entertain him in the best
manner he could. He spread the table before him
with dried fruits of several sorts; and produced a
remnant of old cordial wine, which, as the rigour of
the season made very proper, he mulled with some
warm spices, infused over the fire, and presented to
his shivering guest. But this the Traveller thought
fit to blow likewise; and upon the Satyr’s demanding
a reason why he blowed again, he replied: To cool
his dish. This second answer provoked the Satyr’s
indignation, as much as the first had kindled his surprise.
So, taking the man by the shoulder, he thrust
him out of doors, saying: He would have nothing to
do with a wretch who had so vile a quality as to blow
hot and cold with the same mouth.</p>

who could not be reconciled to such double dealing.
In the moral sense of the Fable, nothing can be more
offensive to one of a sincere heart, than he that blows
with a different breath from the same mouth; who
flatters a man to his face, and reviles him behind his
back. Some again, just like this man, to serve a
present view, will blow nothing but what is warm,
benevolent, and cherishing; and when they have
raised the expectations of a dependant to a degree
which they think may prove troublesome, can, with
putting on a cold air, easily chill and blast all his
blooming hopes. But such a temper, whether it proceeds
from a designed or natural levity, is detestable,
and has been the cause of much trouble and mortification
to many a brave deserving man. Unless
the tenor of a man’s life be always true and consistent
with itself, the less one has to do with him
the better.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XL.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Eagle, the Cat, and the Sow.</span></h3>

<p>An Eagle had built her nest upon the top branches
of an old oak. A wild Cat inhabited a hole in
the middle; and in the hollow part at the bottom
was a Sow, with a whole litter of pigs. A happy
neighbourhood; and might long have continued so,
had it not been for the wicked insinuations of the
designing Cat. For, first of all, up she crept to the
Eagle; and, good neighbour, says she, we shall be all
undone: That filthy Sow yonder does nothing but
lie routing at the foot of the tree, and, as I suspect,
intends to grub it up, that she may the more easily
come at our young ones. For my part I will take
care of my own concerns; you may do as you please,
but I will watch her motions, though I stay at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
this month for it. When she had said this, which
could not fail of putting the Eagle into a great fright,
down she went, and made a visit to the Sow at the
bottom; and, putting on a sorrowful face, I hope,
says she, you do not intend to go abroad to-day?
Why not? says the Sow. Nay, replies the other,
you may do as you please; but I overheard the Eagle
tell her young ones, that she would treat them with a
pig the first time she saw you go out; and I am not
sure but she may take up with a kitten in the meantime;
so, good-morrow to you; you will excuse me,
I must go and take care of the little folks at home.
Away she went accordingly; and, by contriving to
steal out softly at nights for her prey, and to stand
watching and peeping all day at her hole, as under
great concern, she made such an impression upon the
Eagle and the Sow, that neither of them dared to
venture abroad for fear of the other. The consequence
of which was, that themselves, and their young
ones, in a little time were all starved, and made prize
of by the treacherous Cat and her kittens.</p>

<p>Busy-bodies and intermeddlers are a dangerous sort
of people to have to do withal; for there is no mischief
that may not be wrought by the craft and management
of a double tongue, with a foolish credulity
to work upon. There is hardly a greater pest to
government, to conversation, to the peace of societies,
relations, and families, than officious tale-bearers and
busy intermeddlers. These pick-thanks are enough
to set mankind together by the ears; they live upon
calumny and slander, and cover themselves, too, under
the seal of secrecy and friendship; these are the
people who <em>set their neighbours’ houses on fire to roast
their own eggs</em>. The sin of traducing is diabolical,
according to the very letter; and if the office be
artificially managed, it is enough to put the whole
world into a flame, and nobody the wiser which way
it came. The mischief may be promoted, by misrepresenting,
misunderstanding, or misinterpreting our
neighbour’s thoughts, words, and deeds; and no
wound so mortal, as that where the poison works
under a pretence of kindness: nay, there are ways of
commendation, and insinuations of affection and
esteem, that kill a man as sure as a bullet. This
practice is the bane of trust and confidence; and it
is as frequent in the intrigues of courts and states, as
in the most ordinary accidents of life. It is enough
to break the neck of all honest purposes, to stifle all
generous and public-spirited motions, and to suppress
all honourable inclinations in the very conception.
But, next to the practice of these lewd offices, deliver
all honest men, say I, from lying at the mercy of
those that encourage and entertain them.</p>

to the place, who was prowling in that neighbourhood,
in quest of his prey. But <em>Reynard</em>, finding the Cock
was inaccessible, by reason of the height of his situation,
had recourse to stratagem, in order to decoy
him down; so, approaching the tree, Cousin, says
he, I am heartily glad to see you; but at the same
time I cannot forbear expressing my uneasiness at
the inconvenience of the place, which will not let me
pay my respects to you in a handsomer manner;
though I suppose you will come down presently, and
so that difficulty is easily removed. Indeed, Cousin,
says the Cock, to tell you the truth I don’t think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
safe to venture myself upon the ground, for though
I am convinced how much you are my friend, yet I
may have the misfortune to fall into the clutches of
some other beast, and what will become of me then?
O dear, says <em>Reynard</em>, is it possible that you can be
so ignorant, as not to know of the peace that has
been lately proclaimed between all kinds of birds and
beasts; and that we are, for the future, to forbear
hostilities on all sides, and to live in the utmost love
and harmony, and that under penalty of suffering
the severest punishment that can be inflicted? All
this while the Cock seemed to give little attention to
what was said, but stretched out his neck, as if he
saw something at a distance: Cousin, says the Fox,
what’s that you look at so earnestly? Why, says
the Cock, I think I see a pack of hounds yonder a
little way off. Oh then, says the Fox, your humble
servant, I must be gone. Nay, pray, Cousin, don’t
go, says the Cock, I’m just coming down; sure you
are not afraid of dogs in these peaceable times. No,
no, says he; but ten to one whether they have heard
of the proclamation yet.</p>

<p>It is a very agreeable thing to see craft repelled by
cunning; more especially to behold the snares of the
wicked broken and defeated by the discreet management

puts us in mind, not to be too credulous towards
the insinuations of those who are already distinguished
by their want of faith and honesty. When,
therefore, any such would draw us into a compliance
with their destructive measures, by a pretended civility
and extraordinary concern for our interest, we should
consider such proposals in their true light, as a bait
artfully placed to conceal the fatal hook, which is
intended to draw us into captivity and thraldom.
An honest man, with a little plain sense, may do a
thousand advantageous things for the public good;
and, without being master of much address or
rhetoric, as easily convince people that his designs
are intended for their welfare. But a wicked designing
politician, though he has a tongue as eloquent as
ever spoke, may sometimes be disappointed in his
projects and be foiled in his schemes; especially
when their destructive texture is so coarsely spun,
and the threads of mischief are so large in them, as
to be seen even by those whose senses are scarce
perfect enough to see and understand them.</p>

with a thousand cares and troubles in his head, exclaiming
over and over: “Lord, what shall I do to
live?” The other jogged merrily away, and left
his matters to Providence and good fortune. “Well,
brother,” says the sorrowful wight, “how can you

“Good Sir!” says he, “what if I should fall blind?”
and so he walked a good way before his companion

them? and so they really suffer the evils they dread
most. It is very certain, that what we <em>fear</em> we <em>feel</em>;
besides that, fancy breeds misery as naturally as it
does the small-pox. Set a whimsical head once agog
upon sprites and goblins, and he will be ready to
squirt his wits at his own shadow. There is no surer
remedy for this superstitious and desponding weakness,
than first to govern ourselves by the best improvement
of that reason which Providence has given
us for a guide; and then, when we have done our
own part, to commit all cheerfully for the rest to the
good pleasure of Heaven, with trust and resignation.
Why should I not as well comfort myself with the
<em>hope</em> of what may be, as torment myself with the <em>fear</em>
of it? he that distrusts in God’s providence, does
effectually put himself out of His protection.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XLIV.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Young Man and the Swallow.</span></h3>

<p>A prodigal young spendthrift, who had wasted
his whole patrimony in taverns and gaming-houses
among lewd, idle company, was taking a
melancholy walk near a brook. It was in the month
of <em>January</em>, and happened to be one of those warm
sunshiny days which sometimes smile upon us even
in that wintry season of the year; and to make it
the more flattering, a swallow, which had made its
appearance by mistake too soon, flew skimming
along upon the surface of the water. The giddy
youth, observing this, without any further consideration,
concluded that summer was now come, and that
he should have little or no occasion for clothes, so
went and pawned them at the broker’s, and ventured
the money for one stake more, among his sharping
companions. When this too was gone the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with the rest, he took another solitary walk in the
same place as before. But the weather, being severe
and frosty, had made everything look with an aspect
very different from what it did before: the brook
was quite frozen over, and the poor swallow lay dead
upon the bank of it; the very sight of which cooled
the young spark’s brains, and coming to a kind of
sense of his misery, he reproached the deceased bird
as the author of all his misfortunes: Ah, wretch that
thou wert! says he, thou hast undone both thyself
and me, who was so credulous as to depend upon
thee.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>They who frequent taverns and gaming-houses,
and keep bad company, should not wonder if they
are reduced, in a very small time, to penury and
want. The wretched young fellows who once addict
themselves to such a scandalous kind of life, scarce
think of, or attend to, any one thing besides. They
seem to have nothing else in their heads, but how
they may squander what they have got, and where
they may get more when that is gone. They do not
make the same use of their reason that other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
do; but, like the jaundiced eye, view everything in
that false light in which their distemper and debauchery
represent it. The young man in the Fable gives
us a pretty example of this; he sees a swallow in
the midst of winter, and instead of being surprised at
it, as a very irregular and extraordinary thing, concludes
from thence that it is summer, as if he had
never thought before about the season. Well, the
result of this wise conclusion is of a piece with the
conclusion itself; if it is summer, he shall not want
so many clothes, therefore he sells them,—for what?
For more money to squander away; as if (had his
observation been just) summer would have lasted all
the year round. But the true result and conclusion
of all this is: When both his money and clothes are
irrecoverably gone, he comes to his right senses, is
ready to perish with hunger, to starve with cold, and
to tear his own flesh with remorse and vexation at
his former stupidity.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XLV.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Brother and Sister.</span></h3>

<p>A certain man had two children, a son and a
daughter: The boy beautiful and handsome
enough; the girl not quite so well. They were both
very young, and happened one day to be playing
near the looking-glass, which stood on their mother’s
toilet. The boy, pleased with the novelty of the
thing, viewed himself for some time, and, in a wanton
roguish manner, took notice to the girl how handsome
he was. She resented it, and could not bear
the insolent manner in which he did it; for she understood
it (how could she do otherwise) as intended for
a direct affront to her. Therefore she ran immediately
to her father, and, with a great deal of aggravation,
complained of her brother; particularly, for having
acted so effeminate a part as to look in a glass, and
meddle with things which belonged to women only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
The father, embracing them both with much tenderness
and affection, told them, that he should like to
have them both look in the glass every day; to the
intent that you, says he to the boy, if you think that
face of yours handsome, you may not disgrace and
spoil it by an ugly temper and a foul behaviour. You,
says he, speaking to the girl, that you may make up
for the defects of your person, if there be any, by the
sweetness of your manners and the agreeableness of
your conversation.</p>

<p>There is scarce anything we see in the world,
especially what belongs to and hangs about our own
person, but is capable of affording us matter for some
serious and useful consideration. And this Fable,
notwithstanding the scene of it is laid at the very
beginning and entrance of life, yet utters a doctrine
worthy the attention of every stage and degree
thereof, from the child to the old man. Let each of
us take a glass, and view himself considerately. He
that is vain and self-conceited, will find beauties in
every feature, and his whole shape will be without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fault. Let it be so; yet, if he would be complete, he
must take care that the inward man does not detract
from and disgrace the outward; that the depravity of
his manners does not spoil his face, nor the wrongness
of his behaviour distort his limbs; or, which is the
same thing, make his whole person odious and detestable
to the eye of his beholders. Is any one modest
in this respect, and deficient of himself? Or has he
indeed blemishes and imperfections, which may
depreciate him in the sight of mankind? Let him
strive to improve the faculties of the mind, where
perhaps nature has not crampt him; and to excel in
the beauties of a good temper and an agreeable conversation,
the charms of which are so much more
lasting and unalterably endearing, than those of the
other sort. They who are beautiful in person have
this peculiar advantage, that, with a moderate regard
to complaisance and good manners, they bespeak
every one’s opinion in their favour. But then, be the
outside of a man ever so rough and uncouth, if his
acquired accomplishments are but sweet and engaging,
how easily do we overlook the rest, and value
him, like an oriental jewel, not by a glittering outside,
which is common to baser stones, but by his true
intrinsic worth, his bright imagination, his clear
reason, and the transparent sincerity of his honest
heart.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XLVI.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Mice in Council.</span></h3>

<p>The Mice called a General Council; and, having
met, after the doors were locked, entered into
a free consultation about ways and means how to
render their fortunes and estates more secure from
the danger of the Cat. Many things were offered,
and much was debated, <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, upon the matter.
At last a young Mouse, in a fine florid speech, concluded
upon an expedient, and that the only one,
which was to put them, for the future, entirely out of
the power of the enemy: and this was, that the Cat
should wear a bell about her neck, which upon the
least motion would give the alarm, and be a signal
for them to retire into their holes. This speech was
received with great applause, and it was even proposed
by some, that the Mouse who made it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have the thanks of the assembly. Upon which, an
old grave Mouse, who had sat silent all the while,
stood up, and in another speech, owned that the contrivance
was admirable, and the author of it, without
doubt, an ingenious Mouse; but, he said, he thought
it would not be so proper to vote him thanks, till he
should farther inform them how this bell was to be
fastened about the Cat’s neck, and what Mouse would
undertake to do it.</p>

<p>Many things appear feasible in speculation, which
are afterwards found to be impracticable. And
since the execution of anything is that which is to
complete and finish its very existence, what raw
counsellors are those who advise, what precipitate
politicians those who proceed, to the management of
things in their nature incapable of answering their
own expectations, or their promises to others. At the
same time, the Fable teaches us not to expose ourselves
in any of our little politic coffee-house committees,
by determining what should be done upon every
occurrence of maladministration, when we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
neither commission nor power to execute it. He
that, upon such occasion, adjudges, as a preservative
for the state, that this or that should be applied to
the neck of those who have been enemies to it, will
appear full as ridiculous as the Mouse in the Fable,
when the question is asked, Who shall put it there?
In reality we do but expose ourselves to the hatred
of some, and the contempt of others, when we inadvertently
utter our impracticable speculations, in
respect of the public, either in private company or
authorised assemblies.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Fable XLVII.</span></i><br />
<span class="gothic">The Old Man and Death.</span></h3>

<p>A poor feeble old man, who had crawled out into
a neighbouring wood to gather a few sticks, had
made up his bundle, and, laying it over his shoulders,
was trudging homeward with it; but, what with age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and the length of the way, and the weight of his burden,
he grew so faint and weak that he sunk under
it; and, as he sat on the ground, called upon Death
to come, once for all, and ease him of his troubles.
Death no sooner heard him, but he came and demanded
of him what he wanted. The poor old
creature, who little thought Death had been so near,
and frightened almost out of his senses with his
terrible aspect, answered him trembling: That having
by chance let his bundle of sticks fall, and being too
infirm to get it up himself, he had made bold to call
upon him to help him; that, indeed, this was all he
wanted at present; and that he hoped his Worship
was not offended with him for the liberty he had
taken in so doing.</p>

<p>This Fable gives us a lively representation of the

him behind his back, that upon every little cross accident
which happens in their way, Death is immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
called upon; and they even wish it might be
lawful for them to finish by their own hands a life
so odious, so perpetually tormenting and vexatious.
When, let but Death only offer to make his appearance,
and the very sense of his near approach almost
does the business: Oh then, all they want is a longer
life; and they would be glad to come off so well, as
to have their old burden laid upon their shoulders
again. One may well conclude what an utter aversion
they, who are in youth, health, and vigour of
body, have to dying, when age, poverty, and wretchedness,
are not sufficient to reconcile us to the
thought.</p>

<p>Many things which cannot be effected by strength,
or by the old vulgar way of enterprising, may yet be
brought about by some new and untried means. A
man of sagacity and penetration, upon encountering
a difficulty or two, does not immediately despair; but
if he cannot succeed one way, employs his wit and
ingenuity another; and, to avoid or get over an impediment,
makes no scruple of stepping out of the
path of his forefathers. Since our happiness, next to
the regulation of our minds, depends altogether upon
our having and enjoying the conveniences of life, why
should we stand upon ceremony about the methods
of obtaining them, or pay any deference to antiquity
upon that score? If almost every age had not exerted
itself in some new improvements of its own,
we should want a thousand arts; or, at least, many
degrees of perfection in every art, which at present
we are in possession of. The invention of anything
which is more commodious for the mind or body
than what they had before, ought to be embraced
readily, and the projector of it distinguished with a
suitable encouragement. Such as the use of the
compass, for example, from which mankind reaps so
much benefit and advantage, and which was not
known to former ages. When we follow the steps of
those who have gone before us in the old beaten
tract of life, how do we differ from horses in a team,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
which are linked to each other by a chain of harness,
and move on in a dull, heavy pace to the tune of
their leader’s bells? But the man who enriches the
present fund of knowledge with some new and useful
improvement, like a happy adventurer at sea, discovers,
as it were, an unknown land, and imports an
additional trade into his own country.</p>

let our tongues slip in censuring the actions of those
who are, in the opinion of the world, not only of an
unquestioned reputation, so that nobody will believe
what we insinuate against them; but of such an influence,
upon account of their own veracity, that the
least word from them would ruin our credit to all
intents and purposes. If wit be the case, and we
have a satirical vein, which at certain periods must
have a flow, let us be cautious at whom we level it;
for if the person’s understanding be of better proof
than our own, all our ingenious sallies, like liquor
squirted against the wind, will recoil back upon our
own faces, and make us the ridicule of every spectator.
This Fable, besides, is not an improper emblem
of Envy; which, rather than not bite at all, will fall
foul where it can hurt nothing but itself; and such
is its malignancy, that the greatest wits and brightest
characters in all ages have ever been the objects of
its attack. Ought we not, then, to guard against the

<p>Great cry and little wool, is the <em>English</em> proverb;
the sense of which bears an exact proportion to this
Fable. By which are exposed, all those who promise
something exceeding great, but come off with a production
ridiculously little. Projectors of all kinds,
who endeavour by artificial rumours to raise the
expectations of mankind, and then by their mean
performances defeat and disappoint them, have, time
out of mind, been lashed with the recital of this Fable.
How agreeably surprising is it to see an unpromising
favourite, whom the caprice of fortune has placed at
the helm of state, serving the commonwealth with
justice and integrity, instead of smothering and embezzling
the public treasure to his own private and
wicked ends! And on the contrary, how melancholy,
how dreadful! or rather, how exasperating and provoking
a sight is it to behold one, whose constant
declarations for liberty and the public good have raised
people’s expectations of him to the highest pitch, as
soon as he is got into power exerting his whole art
and cunning to ruin and enslave his country! The
sanguine hopes of all those that wished well to virtue,
and flattered themselves with a reformation of everything
that opposed the well-being of the community,
vanish away in smoke, and are lost in a dark, gloomy,
uncomfortable prospect.</p>

<span class="gothic">The Two Frogs.</span></h3>

<p>One hot sultry summer, the lakes and ponds
being almost everywhere dried up, a couple
of Frogs agreed to travel together in search of water.
At last they came to a deep well, and sitting upon
the brink of it, began to consult, whether they should
leap in or no. One of them was for it; urging, that
there was plenty of clear spring water, and no danger
of being disturbed. Well, says t’other, all this may
be true; and yet I can’t come into your opinion for
my life: For, if the water should happen to dry up
here too, how should we get out again?</p>

<p>The moral of this Fable is intended to put us in
mind <em>to look before we leap</em>. That we should not
undertake any action of importance, without considering
first, what the event of it is like to prove, and
how we shall be able to come off, upon such and such
provisos. A good General does not think he diminishes
anything of his character when he looks
forward, beyond the main action, and concerts measures,
in case there should be occasion, for a safe
retreat.</p>

<p>How many unfortunate matches are struck up every
day for want of this wholesome consideration? Profuse
living, and extravagant gaming, both which
terminate in the ruin of those that follow them, are
mostly owing to a neglect of this precaution. Wicked
counsellors advise, and ignorant princes execute those
things, which afterwards they often dearly repent.
Wars are begun by this blind stupidity, from which
a state is not able to extricate itself with either
honour or safety; and projects are encouraged by the
rash accession of those, who never considered how
they were to get out, till they had plunged themselves
irrecoverably into them.</p>

<p>A man who is very free in his protestations of
friendship, or offers of great civility, upon the first
interview may meet with applause and esteem from
fools, but contrives his schemes of that sort to little
or no purpose, in the company of men of sense.</p>

<p>It is a common and known maxim, to suspect an
enemy, even the more, for his endeavouring to convince
us of his benevolence; because the oddness of
the thing puts us upon our guard, and makes us conclude,
that some pernicious design must be couched
under so sudden and unexpected a turn of behaviour:
But it is no unnecessary caution to be upon the watch
against even indifferent people, when we perceive
them uncommonly forward in their approaches of
civility and kindness. The man, who at first sight
makes us an offer, which is due only to particular and
well-acquainted friends, must be either a knave, and
intends by such a bait to draw us into his net; or a
fool, with whom we ought to avoid having any communication.</p>

<p>Thus far the consideration of this Fable may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
useful to us in private life; what it contains farther,
in relation to the public, is, That a man, truly honest,
will never let his mouth be stopped with a bribe; but
the greater the offer is which is designed to buy his
silence, the louder and more constantly will he open
against the miscreants who would practise it upon
him.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>This Fable shews us how vain and ill-grounded the
expectations of those people are, who imagine they
can obtain whatever they want by importuning
heaven with their prayers; for it is so agreeable to
the nature of the Divine Being, to be better pleased
with virtuous actions and an honest industry, than
idle Prayers, that it is a sort of blasphemy to say
otherwise. These were the sentiments of honest good
heathens, who were strangers to all revealed religion:
But it is not strange that they should embrace and
propagate such a notion, since it is no other than the
dictate of common reason. What is both strange in
itself, and surprising how it could be made so fashionable,
is, that most of those whose reason should be
enlightened by Revelation, are very apt to be guilty
of this stupidity, and, by praying often for the comforts
of life, to neglect that business which is the
proper means of procuring them. How such a mistaken
devotion came to prevail, one cannot imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
unless from one of these two motives; either that
people, by such a veil of hypocrisy, would pass themselves
upon mankind for better than they really are;
or are influenced by unskilful preachers (which is
sometimes, indeed too often, the case) to mind the
world as little as possible, even to the neglect of their
necessary callings. No question but it is a great sin
for a man to fail in his trade or occupation, by running
often to prayers: it being a demonstration in
itself, though the Scripture had never said it, that we
please God most, when we are doing the most good:
And how can we do more good, than by a sober
honest industry, <em>to provide for those of our own household</em>,
and to endeavour <em>to have to give to him that
needeth</em>. The man who is virtuously and honestly
engaged, is actually serving God all the while, and is
more likely to have his silent wishes, accompanied
with strenuous endeavours, complied with by the
Supreme Being, than he who begs with a fruitless
vehemence, and solicits with an empty hand: A hand
which would be more religious were it usefully employed,
and more devout, were it stretched forth to
do good to those that want it.</p>

<p>A Kite had been sick a long time; and finding
there were no hopes of recovery, begged of his
mother to go to all the churches and religious houses
in the country, to try what prayers and promises
would effect in his behalf. The old Kite replied:
Indeed, dear Son, I would willingly undertake anything
to save your life, but I have great reason to
despair of doing you any service in the way you propose:
For, with what face can I ask anything of the
Gods in favour of one whose whole life has been a
continued scene of rapine and injustice, and who has
not scrupled upon occasion to rob the very altars
themselves?</p>

<p>The rehearsal of this Fable almost unavoidably
draws our attention to that very serious and important
point, the consideration of a death-bed repentance.
And, to expose the absurdity of relying upon such a
weak foundation, we need only ask the same question
with the Kite in the Fable: How can he, that has
offended the Gods all his life-time by doing acts of
dishonour and injustice, expect that they should be
pleased with him at last, for no other reason but because
he fears he shall not be able to offend them
any longer; when, in truth, such a repentance can
signify nothing, but a confirmation of his former impudence
and folly? For sure no stupidity can exceed
that of the man who expects a future judgment, and
yet can bear to commit any piece of injustice, with a
sense and deliberation of the fact.</p>

have most men to be directors in the affairs of others,
either to shew the superiority of their understanding,
or their own security and exemption from the ills
they would have removed, that they forwardly and
conceitedly obtrude their counsel, even at the hazard
of their own safety and reputation. There have been
instances of those who, either officiously or for the
jest’s sake, have spent much of their time in reading
lectures of economy to the rest of the world, when at

<h4><span class="smcap">Reflection.</span></h4>

<p>This Fable may serve to give us a general view
of the ingratitude of the greatest part of mankind.
Notwithstanding all the civility and complaisance
that is used among people where there is a common
intercourse of business, yet, let the main spring, the
probability of their being serviceable to each other,
either in point of pleasure or profit, be but once
broken, and farewell courtesy. So far from continuing
any regard in behalf of past favours, that it is
very well if they forbear doing anything that is injurious.
If the master had only ceased to caress and
make much of the old Hound when he was past
doing any service, it had not been very strange; but
to treat a poor creature ill, not for a failure of inclination,
but merely a defect of nature, must, notwithstanding
the crowd of examples there are to countenance
it, be pronounced inhuman and unreasonable.</p>

<p>There are two accounts upon which people that
have been useful are frequently neglected. One,
when they are so decayed, either through age or
some accident, that they are no longer equal to the
services they have formerly done; the other, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the occasion or emergency which required such talents
no longer exists. <em>Phædrus</em>, who more than once
complains of the bad consequences of age, makes no
other application to this Fable, than by telling his
friend <em>Philetas</em>, with some regret, that he wrote it
with such a view; having, it seems, been repaid with
neglect, or worse usage, for services done in his youth
to those who were then able to afford him a better
recompense.</p>

<span class="gothic">Two Young Men and the Cook.</span></h3>

<p>Two young men went into a cook’s shop, under
pretence of buying meat; and while the cook’s
back was turned, one of them snatched up a piece of
beef, and gave it to his companion, who presently
clapt it under his cloak. The cook turning about
again, and missing his beef, began to charge them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with it; upon which, he that first took it swore
bitterly he had none of it. He that had it swore as
heartily, that he had taken up none of his meat. Why
look ye, gentlemen, says the cook, I see your equivocation;
and though I can’t tell which of you has
taken my meat, I am sure, between you both, there’s
a thief, and a couple of rascals.</p>

<p>An honest man’s word is as good as his oath; and
so is a rogue’s too; for he that will cheat and lie,
why should he scruple to forswear himself? Is the
latter more criminal than either of the former? An
honest man needs no oath to oblige him; and a rogue
only deceives you the more certainly by it, because
you think you have tied him up, and he is sure you
have not. In truth, it is not easy, with the eye of
reason, to discern, that there is any good in swearing
at all. We need not scruple to take an honest man’s
bare asseveration; and we shall do wrong if we believe
a rogue, though he swears by the most solemn oaths
that can be invented.</p>

<p>There are, besides, a sort of people who are rogues,
and yet don’t know that they are such; who, when
they have taken an oath, make a scruple of breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it, but rack their invention to evade it by some
equivocation or other; by which, if they can but
satisfy their acquaintance, and serve their own scheme
they think all is well, and never once consider the
black and heinous guilt which must attend such a
behaviour. They solemnly call the supreme Being
to witness; to what? to a sham, an evasion, a lie.
Thus these unthinking, prevaricating wretches, at the
same time that they believe there is a God, act as if
there were none; or, which is worse, dare affront him
in the highest degree. They who by swearing would
clear themselves of a crime, of which they are really
guilty, need not be at much pains about wording their
oath; for, express themselves how they will, they are
sure to be forsworn.</p>

<p>Deplorable are the times, when open bare-faced
villany is protected and encouraged, when innocence
is obnoxious, honesty contemptible, and it is reckoned
criminal to espouse the cause of virtue. Men originally
entered into covenants and simple compacts
with each other for the promotion of their happiness
and well-being, for the establishment of justice and
public peace. How comes it then that they look
stupidly on, and tamely acquiesce, when wicked men
pervert this end, and establish an arbitrary tyranny
of their own upon the foundation of fraud and oppression?
Among beasts, who are incapable of being
civilised by social laws, it is no strange thing to see
innocent helpless sheep fall a prey to dogs, wolves,
and kites: But it is amazing how mankind could ever
sink down to such a low degree of base cowardice,
as to suffer some of the worst of their species to usurp
a power over them, to supersede the righteous laws of
good government, and to exercise all kinds of injustice
and hardship in gratifying their own vicious lusts.
Wherever such enormities are practised, it is when a
few rapacious statesmen combine together, to get and
secure the power in their own hands, and agree to
divide the spoils among themselves. For as long as
the cause is to be tried only among themselves, no
question but they will always vouch for each other.
But, at the same time, it is hard to determine which
resemble brutes most, they in acting, or the people
in suffering them to act their vile selfish schemes.</p>

<p>Whenever a man endeavours to live equal with

share a like fate with the Frog in the Fable. How
many vain people of moderate easy circumstances
burst and come to nothing, by vying with those
whose estates are more ample than their own! Sir
<em>Changeling Plumbstock</em> was possessed of a very considerable
demesne, devolved to him by the death of
an old uncle of the city, who had adopted him his
heir. He had a false taste of happiness; and, without
the least economy, trusting to the sufficiency of
his vast revenue, was resolved to be outdone by nobody,
in shewish grandeur and expensive living. He
gave five thousand pounds for a piece of ground in
the country, to set a house upon, the building and
furniture of which cost fifty thousand more; and his
gardens were proportionably magnificent. Besides
which, he thought himself under a necessity of buying
out two or three tenements which stood in his
neighbourhood, that he might have elbow room
enough. All this he could very well bear; and still
might have been happy, had it not been for an unfortunate
view which he one day happened to take
of my Lord <em>Castlebuilder’s</em> gardens, which consist of
twenty acres, whereas his own were not above twelve.
For from that time he grew pensive; and before the
ensuing winter, gave five and thirty years’ purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
for a dozen acres more to enlarge his gardens, built
a couple of exorbitant greenhouses and a large
pavilion at the farther end of a terrace walk, the bare
repairs and superintendencies of all which call for
the remaining part of his income. He is mortgaged
pretty deep, and pays nobody; but, being a privileged
person, resides altogether at a private cheap
lodging in the city of <em>Westminster</em>.</p>

<p>The Bee, compelled by thirst, went to drink in a
clear purling rivulet; but the current, with its
circling eddy, snatched her away, and carried her
down the stream. A Dove, pitying her distressed
condition, cropt a branch from a neighbouring tree,
and let it fall into the water, by means of which the
Bee saved herself, and got ashore. Not long after,
a Fowler, having a design upon the Dove, planted
his nets and all his little artillery in due order, without
the Bird’s observing what he was about; which
the Bee perceiving, just as he was going to put his
design in execution she bit him by the heel, and
made him give so sudden a start, that the Dove took
the alarm, and flew away.</p>

<p>One good turn deserves another; and gratitude is
excited by so noble and natural a spirit, that he
ought to be looked upon as the vilest of creatures,
who has no sense of it. It is, indeed, so very just
and equitable a thing, and so much every man’s duty,
that to speak of it properly one should not mention
it as anything meritorious, or that may claim praise
and admiration, any more than we should say a man
ought to be rewarded or commended for not killing
his father, or forbearing to set fire to his neighbour’s
house. The bright and shining piece of morality,
therefore, which is recommended to us in this Fable,
is set forth in this example of the Dove, who, without
any obligation or expectation, does a voluntary office
of charity to its fellow-creature in distress. The constant
uninterrupted practice of this virtue is the only
thing in which we are capable of imitating the great
Author of our being, whose <em>Beloved Son</em>, besides the
many precepts He has given to enforce this duty,
used this expression as a common saying, <em>It is more
blessed to give than to receive</em>.</p>

<p>It is of no small importance in life, to be cautious
what company we keep, and with whom we enter into
friendships. For though we are ever so well disposed
ourselves, and happen to be ever so free from vice
and debauchery, yet, if those with whom we frequently
converse are engaged in a lewd, wicked
course, it will be almost impossible for us to escape
being drawn in with them.</p>

<p>If we are truly wise, and would shun those <em>siren</em>
rocks of pleasure upon which so many have split
before us, we should forbid ourselves all manner of
commerce and correspondence with those who are
steering a course which, reason tells us, is not only
not for our advantage, but must end in our destruction.</p>

<p>All the virtue we can boast of will not be sufficient
to ensure us, if we embark in bad company. For
though our philosophy were such, as that we could
preserve ourselves from being tainted and infected
with their manners, yet their character would twist
and entwine itself along with ours in so intricate a
fold, that the world would not take the trouble to
unravel and separate them. Reputations are of a
subtle insinuating texture like water; that which is
derived from the clearest spring, if it chances to mix
with a foul current, runs on, undistinguished, in one
muddy stream for the future, and must for ever partake
of the colour and condition of its associate.</p>

home to his mother; who was so far from correcting
and discouraging him upon account of the theft, that
she commended and gave him an apple for his pains.
In process of time, as the child grew up to be a man,
he accustomed himself to greater robberies; and at
last, being apprehended and committed to gaol, he
was tried and condemned for a felony. On the day
of his execution, as the officers were conducting him
to the gallows, he was attended by a vast crowd of
people, and among the rest by his mother, who came
sighing and sobbing along, and deploring extremely
her son’s unhappy fate; which the criminal observing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he called to the sheriff, and begged the favour of him,
that he would give him leave to speak a word or two
to his poor afflicted mother. The sheriff (as who
would deny a dying man so reasonable a request)
gave him permission; and the felon, while every one
thought he was whispering something of importance
to his mother, bit off her ear, to the great offence and
surprise of the whole assembly. What, say they, was
not this villain contented with the impious acts which
he has already committed, but he must increase the
number of them, by doing this violence to his mother?
Good people, replied he, I would not have you be
under a mistake; that wicked woman deserves this,
and even worse at my hands; for if she had chastised
and chid, instead of rewarding and caressing me,
when in my infancy I stole the horn-book from the

one need not scruple to affirm, that most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
wickedness, which is so frequent and so pernicious in
the world, arises from a bad education; and that the
child is obliged either to the example or connivance
of its parents, for most of the vicious habits which it
wears through the course of its future life. The mind
of one that is young is, like wax, soft and capable of
any impression which is given it: but it is hardened
by time, and the first signature grows so firm and
durable, that scarce any pains or application can
erase it. It is a mistaken notion in people, when they
imagine that there is no occasion for regulating or
restraining the actions of very young children, which
though allowed to be sometimes very naughty in those
of a more advanced age, are in them, they suppose,
altogether innocent and inoffensive. But, however
innocent they may be, as to their intention then, yet,
as the practice may grow upon them unobserved, and
root itself into a habit, they ought to be checked and
discountenanced in their first efforts towards anything
that is injurious or dishonest; that the love of virtue
and the abhorrence of wrong and oppression may
be let into their minds, at the same time that they
receive the very first dawn of understanding, and
glimmering of reason. Whatever guilt arises from
the actions of one whose education has been deficient
as to this point, no question but a just share of
it will be laid, by the great Judge of the world, to the
charge of those who were, or should have been, his
instructors.</p>

moved with what he said, went quietly and calmly
on with his work: and, in the evening, was unyoked

least, despise the poor honest man, who is contented
with the virtuous product of his daily labour, and
patiently submits to his destiny. But how often is
the poor man comforted, by seeing these wanton
villains led in triumph to the altar of justice, while
he has many a cheerful summer’s morning to enjoy
abroad, and many a long winter’s evening to indulge
himself in at home, by a quiet hearth, and under an
unenvied roof: Blessings, which often attend a sober,
industrious man, though the idle and the profligate
are utter strangers to them.</p>

<p>Luxury and intemperance, besides their being certain
to shorten a man’s days, are very apt not only
to engage people with their seeming charms into a
debauched life, utterly prejudicial to their health, but
to make them have a contempt for others, whose good
sense and true taste of happiness inspire them with
an aversion to idleness and effeminacy, and put them
upon hardening their constitution by innocent exercise
and laudable employment. How many do gluttony
and sloth tumble into an untimely grave! while
the temperate and the active drink sober draughts of
life, and spin out their thread to the most desirable
length.</p>

<span class="gothic">Jupiter and the Herdsman.</span></h3>

<p>A Herdsman, missing a young heifer that
belonged to his herd, went up and down the
forest to seek it. And having walked a great deal of
ground to no purpose, he fell a praying to <em>Jupiter</em> for
relief; promising to sacrifice a Kid to him, if he would
help him to a discovery of the thief. After this, he
went on a little farther, and came near a grove of
oaks, where he found the carcase of his heifer, and a
lion grumbling over it, and feeding upon it. This
sight almost scared him out of his wits; so down he
fell upon his knees once more, and addressing himself
to <em>Jupiter</em>; O <em>Jupiter</em>! says he, I promised thee a
Kid to show me the thief, but now I promise thee a
bull, if thou wilt be so merciful as to deliver me out
of his clutches.</p>

<p>How ignorant and stupid are some people, who
form their notions of the Supreme Being from their
own poor shallow conceptions; and then, like froward
children with their nurses, think it consistent
with infinite wisdom and unerring justice to comply
with all their whimsical petitions. Let men but live
as justly as they can, and just Providence will give
them what they ought to have. Of all the involuntary
sins which men commit, scarce any are more frequent,
than that of their praying absurdly and improperly, as
well as unseasonably, when their time might have
been employed so much better. The many private
collections, sold up and down the nation, do not a
little contribute to this injudicious practice: Which
is the more to be condemned, in that we have so incomparable
a public liturgy; one single address
whereof (except the Lord’s Prayer) may be pronounced
to be the best that ever was compiled; and
alone preferable to all the various manuals of
occasional devotion, which are vended by hawkers
and pedlars about our streets. It is as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, who
knowest our necessities before we ask, and our ignorance
in asking; we beseech thee to have compassion upon our
infirmities; and those things, which for our unworthiness
we dare not, and for our blindness we cannot ask,
vouchsafe to give us, for the worthiness of thy Son

<p>A Man, who had lived a very profligate life, at
length being awakened by the lively representations
of a sober friend on the apprehensions of
a feverish indisposition, promised that he would
heartily set about his reformation, and that To-morrow
he would seriously begin it. But the
symptoms going off, and that To-morrow coming, he
still put it off till the next, and so he went on from
one To-morrow to another; but still he continued his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
reprobate life. This his friend observing, said to him,
I am very much concerned to find how little effect my
disinterested advice has upon you: But, my friend, let
me tell you, that since your To-morrow never comes,
nor do you seem to intend it shall, I will believe you
no more, except you set about your repentance and
amendment this very moment: for, to say nothing of
your repeated broken promises, you must consider,
that the time that is past is no more; that To-morrow
is <em>not</em> OURS; and the <em>present</em> NOW is all we have to
boast of.</p>

<p>Whoever considers this emblem, will find it to be
his own case; we promise, and we put off, and we sin,
and go on sinning: but still, as our conscience checks
us for it, we take up faint purposes, and half resolutions,
to do so no more, and to lead a new life for the
future. Thus, with the young fellow here, we indulge
ourselves in our pleasures from time to time; and
when we have trifled away our lives, day after day,
from one To-morrow to another, that same To-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
never comes. This is the sluggard’s plea and practice;
the libertine’s, the miser’s; and in short, whose is it
not? Now, if we would but consider the vanity and
vexation of a lewd course of life; the impiety first of
entering into vows, which we intend beforehand not
to perform, and afterward of breaking them; the
folly and the presumption of undertaking anything
that is wholly out of our power; the necessity of
improving every moment of our lives; the desperate
and the irreparable hazard of losing opportunities;
we should not venture body and soul upon the
necessity of a procrastinated repentance, and postpone
the most certain duties of a man, and of a
Christian; for there is no To-morrow, nor anything,
in truth, but the present instant, that we can call our
own.</p>

<div class="verse">A mere papilio of the day,</div>

<div class="verse">And haunt, by turns, the stream and grove:</div>
<div class="verse">A silver zone entwin’d his head,</div>
<div class="verse">His belly shone with lively red,</div>
<div class="verse">His wings were green, but studded o’er</div>
<div class="verse">With gold-embroider’d spots before.</div>

<div class="verse">(If I may be thought fit t’advise)</div>
<div class="verse">In careless indolence and ease,</div>
<div class="verse">Not suff’ring anything to tease,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now rose the Hog, and with a grunt,</div>

<div class="verse">And fool’d away in Monkey mirth,</div>
<div class="verse">It’s really full as little worth;</div>
<div class="verse">For doing nothing worthy fame</div>
<div class="verse">And doing nothing’s much the same.</div>
<div class="verse">But if you’d real pleasure know,</div>
<div class="verse">Let generous liquor smiling flow;</div>

<div class="verse">And drink, and sing, and rant, and roar:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thus every care will sink and drown,</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst mirth and joy run laughing round.</div>

<div class="verse">And you’ll be a god do you but think so.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Here bursts the Goat into a laugh,</div>
<div class="verse">And thus beginning with a scoff:</div>
<div class="verse">“Doubtless,” said he, “it must be fine</div>
<div class="verse">T’exalt a nasty, dirty swine,</div>
<div class="verse">To such a height in fancying,</div>
<div class="verse">As to believe himself a King.</div>
<div class="verse">But that which thus perverts our senses</div>
<div class="verse">Can have, I think, but small pretences</div>
<div class="verse">To recommend it to our favour,</div>
<div class="verse">As pleasure of the truest flavour.</div>
<div class="verse">Nature, methinks, should guide in this,</div>
<div class="verse">Who seems t’have shewn the highest bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">In having plac’d the sweetest gust,</div>
<div class="verse">In gratifying natural lust.</div>
<div class="verse">And that ’tis the sublimest joy,</div>
<div class="verse">I think ’s so plain none can deny.</div>
<div class="verse">Witness the mad tormenting pain,</div>
<div class="verse">When disappointed, we sustain.</div>
<div class="verse">Witness how eagerly we press on,</div>
<div class="verse">Witness our raptures in possession.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Expos’d his beauteous spots to show,</div>
<div class="verse">And with a grave majestic face,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus gave his verdict in the case:</div>
<div class="verse">“Pleasure consists not in such short</div>
<div class="verse">Imperfect transitory sport,</div>
<div class="verse">Of which the pains we’re at to get it,</div>
<div class="verse">O’erpays the bliss when we come at it;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Nor can it e’er be call’d true joy,</div>
<div class="verse">With such a mixture of alloy.</div>
<div class="verse">No, that must be the most refin’d</div>
<div class="verse">Which most exalts and charms the mind;</div>
<div class="verse">And nothing sure more charming is,</div>
<div class="verse">Than honour, pomp, and dignities,</div>
<div class="verse">Than grandeur and magnificence,</div>
<div class="verse">Than sumptuous trains and vast expense,</div>
<div class="verse">Than place, distinction, and preferment,</div>
<div class="verse">And when we die, a grand interment.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">At this the Horse, with noble look,</div>
<div class="verse">Raising his crested neck, thus spoke:</div>
<div class="verse">“That merit should be rais’d on high,</div>
<div class="verse">I think ’s so just none can deny;</div>
<div class="verse">But he who places all his bliss</div>
<div class="verse">In the external pomp of this,</div>
<div class="verse">Knows not what greatness, nor what pleasure is;</div>
<div class="verse">His judgment errs as much at least</div>
<div class="verse">As his who thinks that painting best</div>
<div class="verse">Which is in gaudiest colours drest.</div>
<div class="verse">Of both we may affirm the same,</div>
<div class="verse">Their taste lies only in the gilded frame.</div>
<div class="verse">I grant preferment, honour, place,</div>
<div class="verse">Are rising steps to happiness;</div>
<div class="verse">But whilst we’re upwards thus aspiring,</div>
<div class="verse">We’re anxious still, and still desiring.</div>
<div class="verse">To act with an unbounded will,</div>
<div class="verse">Can only our desires fulfil;</div>
<div class="verse">Whence, the highest bliss, in my opinion,</div>
<div class="verse">Must be in power and dominion.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus all their various sense exprest,</div>
<div class="verse">And each advis’d what he thought best:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But still what each as best esteem’d</div>
<div class="verse">Was by the next that spoke condemn’d:</div>
<div class="verse">Meanwhile the savage monarch sate,</div>
<div class="verse">Attentive to the warm debate;</div>
<div class="verse">The nature saw, without disguise,</div>
<div class="verse">Of every beast in his advice.</div>
<div class="verse">But soon the disputants grew rude,</div>
<div class="verse">Confusion, noise, tumultuous feud</div>
<div class="verse">Enrage the jarring multitude.</div>
<div class="verse">Till weary’d out, the royal beast</div>
<div class="verse">Thus spoke, and silenc’d all the rest:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Cease, cease your vain contention, cease</div>
<div class="verse">Your shallow schemes of happiness;</div>
<div class="verse">Which only have confirm’d me more,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis where I thought it was before.</div>
<div class="verse">Greatness is no establishment</div>
<div class="verse">Of real bliss, or true content;</div>
<div class="verse">Luxurious banquets soon disgust;</div>
<div class="verse">We’re quickly pall’d with sensual lust:</div>
<div class="verse">Virtue alone can give true joy;</div>
<div class="verse">The sweets of virtue never cloy.</div>
<div class="verse">To take delight in doing good,</div>
<div class="verse">In justice, truth, and gratitude,</div>
<div class="verse">In aiding those whom cares oppress,</div>
<div class="verse">Administ’ring comfort to distress:</div>
<div class="verse">These, these are joys which all who prove</div>
<div class="verse">Anticipate the bliss above.</div>
<div class="verse">These are the joys, and these alone</div>
<div class="verse">We ne’er repent or wish undone.”</div>
<div class="verse">He spoke; the beasts without delay</div>
<div class="verse">Rose from their seats, and sneak’d away.</div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This alludes to the well-known Fable of <i>The Fox and the Grapes</i>,
which, however absurd it may appear in this part of the world, is not
so in the East, for Dr Hasselquist, in his Travels, p. 184, observes,
that “the Fox is an animal common in <em>Palestine</em>, and that there is
plenty of them near the convent of St John in the Desert about vintage
time; and they destroy all the vines unless they are strictly watched.”
To the same effect <em>Solomon</em> saith in the <em>Canticles</em>, ii. 15, “<em>Take us the
Foxes, the little Foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender
grapes.</em>” Therefore this ancient Apologue is very properly restored,
without prejudice to nature or common sense.</p>
